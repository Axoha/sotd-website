Auto crawled throughout the walls of the deeper levels. The pipes hissed, any file from previous levels were irrelevant, he needed to know more. It was pitch-black, but luckily his only eye could serve as a flashlight. He lit his way as he descended, navigating through the maze.

"Yo, what's up?" A familiar voice sound throughout the darkness.

Auto stared at the voice's direction, there he was. Gabriel was caught munching on yet another cookie. "What are *you* doing here?"

"It seems that both of us have gone here for the same thing." He munched more, "I did find something, but I don't think you'll like it."

"I have been lost here for *days*. *Please*, just lead me *somewhere* that would *aid my curiosity.*" He pleaded.

"Sure, follow me." Gabriel replied, breaking a wall to lead back into the hallways.

**It was the year 5699.**

Exactly three years after the four of them, Emilia, Akimi, Laura, and Stanford, were given the title of a hero. They were formed into a generic squad named the "522nd Stealth Division" and were given orders to fulfill every week. Each of them were equipped with the latest experimental weaponry, some were shoddy from time to time, but they managed to find a way, always. Their first day was of course a struggle, some had to deal with trauma they'd simply have to outgrow, which they eventually did. The orders were often simple, "get rid of a Resistance team leader" or "aid the knights in a raid". After a few weeks it began to feel more like a chore rather than a dance between life and death, but sometimes they'd also get intense orders that required them to travel into a whole different galaxy to assist a frontline push against the whole Bastion itself. There were a lot of close calls, but they always remained strong together.
Their third anniversary of constant orders wasn't special, they usually partied like crazy at each anniversary before but this year they had to push it for next week. Since the start of the current year Akimi acted strange, he began to question more. Laura and Stanford, despite being just friends were privately ordered to love, which took a huge toll on both of them. Emilia was the same as usual, but she wondered where the energy of the group has gone to. One day Akimi invited her to the rooftop which was his favorite place to look at the distant gilded city.

"Emilia." He softly spoke once he saw her, "How have you been?"

The wind was strong, howling. "I've been okay." She replied, leaning into the fence. They looked at the city together side by side.

"That's lovely to hear." He talked, "I have been thinking."

"Thinking of what?" She asked.

"I feel like there's much more to life than just these endless missions." He continued, "Both of us have been pushing thirties, don't you feel the same way?"

"Are you saying you wanna quit?" Surprised, she exclaimed.

"Yes." He calmly replied, "I want to live a peaceful life, expand on the talents we have."

Emilia was quite shocked by his response, she didn't know what exactly to say.

"We could be out there living in peace instead of just mercilessly slaughtering what we're assigned to every week. I just want to live a life with you, free from the Holy Earth's grasp." He sighed.

Emilia took a moment to think, she remembered the fragmented memories of her younger self shook and scared. "But what if it doesn't work out? What if we end up at the complete bottom?"

"There isn't a need to worry. We have all the necessary documents, we have enough experience, there is not a single way where we would sink in the regular world." He turned his head to Emilia and smiled. 

Emilia looked at him, and turned back to the city to think more. "Yes." She muttered.

"Huh?" He tilted his head with question, he didn't quite understand.

"Yes! I want to be with you!" She excitedly spout, light tears flew from her eyes as she leapt to hug Akimi. He wrapped his arms around her in return, smiling as he closed his eyes.

The next day would come, Akimi and Emilia came up to Laura and Stanford explaining their current plan. They were bound to quit anyway, as Laura's status would not let her continue. The end of their group was not mourned or celebrated, it was a peaceful agreement. Laura grew more relaxed towards Emilia contrary to their constant rivalry since the year began, which did warm their soul a little. Together they strutted down to the conference hall, where they would explain their end and future plan to the seven Directors.

But they didn't have to explain anything, they already knew.

"Foolish, foolish, FOOLISH!" The first Director, Xavier, yelled. "Such TREASON will NEVER be tolerated."

"We cannot let you abandon your cause until you're free by our word." The third Director continued.

The Seventh Director remained sat on his throne. His massive presence intimidated the group, there was no expression, he just seemed to stare.
But he raised his hand, and with it a finger.

"*Do not disobey.*"

And that was the only sentence he spoke.

Thunder unusually crackled outside, paired with the noise of raindrops pouring down on the Core. The group, clearly not having a word here, were let out by the Directors on a last warning. They sighed in unison.

"I will listen, I will comply to their rules. We will not leave, got it?" Akimi suddenly spout.

Everyone else turned back to him with a "Huh?", but upon seeing him they noticed he quickly wrote something on a piece of paper with a thick black marker. He turned and showed the paper only to the group. It read, "TMRW 7:00", and he grinned.

"Yup, we won't leave, got it." The rest of the group told Akimi, with totally serious intent.

The next morning came, and with it their unspoken plan was gonna begin. The storm grew even wilder, the wind strong enough to blow a person away. They all put on thick raincoats to not be recognizable by any cameras nor get too wet, even if they'd spend most of their travel inside a car. They were headed directly into the train station, each person was already packed with basic necessities. Emilia drove the car, the silence being a little too deafening, she began to sing one of her favorite songs. The group at first looked at her awkwardly, but then Laura joyfully joined in and then the rest as well. Akimi tapped his hands to make a beat, they all bopped their heads and enjoyed their times until a massive lightning bolt hit the city and summoned a Guardian Angel.

The world stood still for that moment, everything went silent.

The Angel, a massive sphere dotted with four eyes loomed over the city. It walked using its diamond limbs, changing, to not cause any damage. Their phones issues an immediate warning, but that was not of their worry, Emilia stepped on the gas and went full speed directly to the city. The Core aimed its cannons towards the Angel and fired, using everything at its disposal. Capital ships appeared in the sky as well, immediately firing orbital strikes. The Angel was unaffected, but very aggravated, it used one of it's morphing limbs to strike a capital ship with ease from the sky. Emilia swerved and turned, avoiding any of the misfired shots. The Angel slowly approached the Core, in a flash destroying any and all defense measures with each step it took. Emilia was relieved amidst the chaos that their path was safer, though collapsed buildings would complicate the route. The Angel stood in front of the Core, blinking, it's shell was as big as the Core itself. Without a second to waste it impaled the ground and spread out the wasteland, making a way into the deepest level that housed the six sacred angels as the source of power. Emilia drifted right at the entrance and opened the doors. The wind continued to howl, everyone swiftly stepped out of the car and rushed to the station to aboard their specific express.

But Emilia froze, as she ran behind everyone she turned back and noticed the wreckage. She wasn't certain what would happen if the Angel did reach whatever it was going for, and with that grew more worry. 
Stanford was at the front, he ran and immediately input their desired timeline, but before he could affirm the choice, a black chain surrounded and clasped his leg which pulled him through a portal that lead to seemingly nowhere. Laura noticed and tried her best to pull him back, but she failed, he was gone without a trace all of a sudden. There wasn't any time for a reaction, the power flickered as the distant roars of war sound through the city. Akimi caught up to Laura who was pushed back on the floor, he helped her get up and aboard the express, but he noticed that Emilia was missing. There was no time left, Akimi initiated the launch sequence of the express without boarding, Laura banged on the windows, yelling with confusion and despair, abruptly disappearing leaving behind energy particles. 
Akimi rushed back to the entrance and found Emilia who was frozen at the entrance. 

"Why are you stalling?!" He yelled out at her.

She continued staring at the chaos, tears dropped down from her face. She sobbed, "I'm so sorry."

She tried to run off back into her car, but Akimi grabbed her by the hand. "Please, just tell me,  what's going on?" A hint of desperation flooded his voice.

"I will kill that Angel, I can't let this place writhe in ruins." Her voice cracked, she didn't even look back at Akimi.

"Angels are our ALLIES!" He tried his best to persuade her, "Destroying an Angel goes against EVERYTHING we fought for!!!"

"It's not the case here." She exclaimed, tilting her head down. Her hand slipped from Akimi's grasp and she made a run for her car. He tried to chase after her, but eventually slowed down to stopping, he realized and accepted the situation, grieving.

Emilia made her way back into the Core. Soaking wet she ran through the hallways into the weapons control room. She turned off any and all automatic modes and manually aimed the cannons directly at the Angel's eye. She fired once, ineffective shot. She fired again, hit, she fired again and again, loading shells infused with the Sacred Angels' blood. The Angel sustained the hits and focused on the cannons, but before it could do that Emilia dealt the final blow. The Angel recoiled back, the massive shell falling onto the ground creating a huge impact. It's limbs slowly disintegrated into butterflies, and the rain has gone away. The Holy Earth sustained heavy damage to it's capital and the Core, it was a day the Directors would never forget.
During the afternoon.

"Akimi, I did it." She spoke to him, they both stood facing each other in front of the Core.

He didn't respond, he only looked at her with tired eyes.

"After the world is rebuilt we can continue with our dream!" She exclaimed, hoping to break his silence.

"Get out of my sight." He finally spoke, quietly.

"Huh?" Emilia was frightened by the response.

"You." His arms trembled with anger, "You betrayed us, you have ruined everything!" His voice crackled.

"I- I was only protecting the world!" She replied with a hint of sadness. She tried to get closer to him but he pushed her away, she fell on her back and looked at Akimi.

"I don't even want to argue." He coldly spoke, "I never want to see you ever again."

He walked away, Emilia never saw him after.
She was left on the broken concrete floor, devastated, filled with regret. In the next coming days she was praised as a true hero by Holy Earth's official, but she was unresponsive with emotion. Every day felt the same since.
The Directors have proposed a special operation for Emilia codenamed "Operation 700". She would become an even more powerful asset for the Holy Earth, her body would be infused with demonic matter harvested from an unknown source, sacrificing her eye in the process. The operation was swift and successful due to her broken soul, but it was not over yet. She would adopt a new identity for "Operation 720" based off the cursed variants codenamed "ENA". Her name would become Rila, and the search for the perfect child began. It took only four attempts to find the true Ferdinand Ray, the child that was forcefully matched by the Directors.

**"CONNECTION - 20A - FINAL DESTINATION REACHED - WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED YOUR STAY AT THE HOLY EARTH!"**

Ferdinand stared at his mother's grave.
