After sleeping for a long fat while, he finds himself awake covered in sweat in an unrecognizable place. Unable to fully move, feeling like garbage, Ferdinand proceeds to take out his journal from the bag as he settles deeper into this new cozy bed. 
"Unfamiliar ceiling, unfamiliar room, where am I? This is probably how hospitals look like here, or is it? This looks like a regular bedroom with its homely scent.. Private hospital backroom? There's a window here, if only I could stand up and see the holy earth for real... I only see the tips of the golden spires. Where's the lady? I didn't even get to do anything over there, instead I just ended up embarrassing myself... I can't believe that the effects of the whole journey were that bad, I thought it'd be a simple pushover, no big deal, like"

"Nice shirt" Rila smugly interrupts Ferdinand's writing as she casually leans against a wall. Crossed arms, wide smile, she stares back at his eyes.

"I- I'm REALLY sorry about-"

"Don't be sorry about anything lovely... Next time take the meds before travelling, or else you'll end up being dust. C'mon, hold onto my hands and we'll stand you up."

Ferdinand, flustered at her remark, took a while to hold her hands. Her hands were cold and dry, he looks up from her hands to her face, staring down on him with smug eyes and a wide smile. Suddenly he feels her fingers press against his wrist.

"Your heartrate is dangerously high, you're not going to die on me again are you?"

"I'm.. NOT sure! WHERE're we even going?!" Unable to collect his train of thought, Ferdinand's head is literally crushing him. Rila stares at him, her smile gone, looking down thinking.

"I've taken you here to my apartment so you can recover, now we'll drive to the Core to set things up, easy as?" Rila pulls Ferdinand from the bed and let's go off his sweaty hands. She hugs him, ensuring he calms down before. "It'll be fine, I know everything can be a shocker for the first time."

"Yeah... yeah..." He lets out deep breaths, slowly calming down.

"Okay, let's get you back on track! We have to get ready and dress formally, I already have a suit ready for you in the wardrobe, tell me if I got the right size."

Ferdinand looks back on the bed trying to find his journal, but gets distracted immediately by the sight of seeing Rila undress. Looking away instantly, she noticed.

"Despite being a long time important figure in this place, we all share tiny compact apartments. Isn't that crazy? You just have to get comfortable with it until you get your own room." She shamelessly says to Ferdinand across the bed. 
But he's weirded out, confused, nervous, Rila scares him, but he also feels loved like at home. Strangely comfortable despite the awkward and weird scene. It's like as if they knew each other since forever, best friends since childhood. There was a connection between them but it wasn't clear, Ferdinand's mind was twisted and overheated. Who was she? How does she know him? His mind was spinning, everything is wrong yet right at the same time.

"Here's your suit, everything's cool, I'll wait outside for you." Rila passes by him, handing him the suit he forgot to take out.

"Thanks..." He looks down at the suit in his hands, which smells like it's been freshly bought from a store.

After that whole ordeal, Ferdinand comes out of the apartment to the sight of seeing Rila dressed up in classic gothic fashion. Dressing formally? That was probably not the right word to use. Ferdinand stood there dressed in a white tuxedo suit with gilded rims and a bowtie his father used to have. 

"I recognize that bowtie. I met your father a few times but never got around to actually talking." 

"Excuse me?" Confused, Ferdinand raises his eyebrow.

"I mean, the suit suits you. Let's go to the car we're running late." She laughs it off, already heading to the garage.

They both get into her car, to Ferdinand's surprise it was nothing fancy. Flying cars aren't a thing, but everything runs on electricity. As they drove around the streets Ferdinand stared in awe at the sky surrounded by golden pillars, like a little kid during a winter's night. The car, so luxurious and comfy. The roads, efficient and clean with blue highlights. The world looked like as if it were built out of gold, a Midas' touch. Perfectly optimized for everyone, this was humanity's peak. Rila noticed Ferdinand frantically looking around out from the windows, even the back window, and also the front window. Her wide smile encompasses her face once more as she looks at him.

"Isn't the world just beautiful? Simply just believing and uniting does wonders." Rila randomly spouts. 

"YES!!!" Without breath to gather words, Ferdinand with his big pupils continued to fanboy about the Holy Earth. This is what he's dreamt of his whole life.

"Just don't be so energetic around the director, he doesn't like that." 

As a red traffic light came on, Rila had the urge to tell Ferdinand a lot of things that aren't just publicly available. But as they were waiting, patience ran out and she randomly started talking about random things.

"Hey, you know why we're so anatomically different? Why everyone here is so different?"

"...No?"

"Of course you don't know, it all began since travel across timelines was discovered. Turning into pure energy that grinds across an artificial line can create dangerous mutations. We like to call them quirks, it can range from being just bigger or smaller to unexplainable anomalies. These 'quirks' are always passed on whenever someone reproduces, and that's how we came to be. Weird and big, isn't that neat?"

"...Yeah, I guess that's pretty neat. Why isn't that information available to anyone? Seems pretty obvious to be everywhere by now." Ferdinand looks at Rila with a questioning stare.

"The Holy Earth is like an iceberg, you don't even know 2% of this place despite being the biggest fan I've met in awhile. Information regarding the Holy Earth is strictly controlled, and so it's just boring keeping everything to myself." Rila's wide smile turns into a soft frown after talking about this topic.

"Oh... But will I get to found out more about this 'everything' when I get the job?" He tilts his head in curiosity.

"About that..." Rila stops the car, and a backseat door suddenly opens and a small anthropomorphic alien axolotl wearing a welding mask jumps into the seat and buckles in. 

"What is that." Ferdinand slowly turns his head towards Rila after looking at the axolotl, his stare emanating nothing but worry.

"It's name is Wall, it comes from a unique variation of species from our original timeline, you know what happened."

Ferdinand looks back at Wall, it's small beady eyes and a huge wide mouth smiling at his presence.

"I'm scared."

"Get used to it, you're gonna work with Wall."

"Oh dear."

Rila starts up the car again and sets off to the next stop. The environment still being the same golden spires towering to the skies. 

"Fun fact, this variation of axolotls have mouths so big, they could bite off pretty much anyone's head if they tried!" Rila laughs.

"You're not making this any better." Ferdinand replies with worry.

"Don't bring bad vibes, Wall WILL weld you onto an object if you upset it. Think of it as a baby with a talent for welding, but ALSO don't underestimate it."

"Ah, okay, got it..."

The car stops once more, this time some sort of giant entity crammed into the car, completely filling up the backseat of the car. 

"OH who's that?!" Ferdinand shockingly yaps. 

"That's Hano, comes from the unknown timeline branch. Before you ask he's not an angel."

"Hello RILA." 

"Yo what's up, hand over Wall there's no space for him left."

"OKAY." Hano proceeds to very gently hold Wall and gives it to Rila, who then hands over Wall to Ferdinand's lap.

"Sorry, I gotta drive, you have to hold Wall for the time being."

"I mean, it can't be that bad?" Ferdinand thinks to himself as he stares at Wall.

The car starts for the last time, their destination now would be to the Core. Rila's favorite pop music would be playing in the car while Hano slept in the backseat. Wall and Ferdinand would have a silent staring competition, every time Ferdinand would move, Wall would use its grabby little hands and adjust him back to the staring competition. One thing that was running through his mind, how did Wall get dressed up for the event? Hano he could understand but Wall was just disturbing to him, staring at him with its small, beady eyes. The car would suddenly stop, and Wall would be sent flying.

"We're here, the most important building of our Holy Earth." Rila says as she gets out of the car with serious intention.

Everyone else would also get out of the car, this was the crater left by the collider during the calamity. A massive building would stand in the exact middle of the barren empty crater. The crew would watch in awe and worry, while Rila would walk right inside.

"Ah, excellent, everyone's here." An old man would speak, surrounded by guards. 

The inside of the building was dark, with a shiny floor made of marble and golden rims. 

"Director Xavier, that is my name. From this day you will now be under our control, you will put the CORE before your life, you will become a necessary step in progression to ascension. This building, you are to protect the six angels at any cost. Failure will result in execution, and colossal failure will bring another calamity not only to us, but everything that exists. A message from heavens has been sent, and we must oblige."

"Heavens and humanities wishes will come true, for Holy Earth, for everything."

Rila would softly speak and kneel down, the rest of the crew would do the same. Ferdinand would struggle, and as he clumsily kneels down, he couldn't help but notice that Director X. was staring at him with mean eyes. Everything he just heard would hit him like a truck, this is not what he went to the Holy Earth for, but now, he felt the weight of everything on his back.

"Director Xavier, under your allowance, can I spend time with Ferdinand before-"

"Do with him and this group as you wish, you are the commander, no time to waste." He would rudely interrupt Rila and flaunt his cape, walking away into the darkness with guards following him.

Ferdinand, with clear sadness in his eye would look desperately at Rila. Worry, confusion, hopelessness would fill him up on the inside. Rila would proceed to hold Ferdinand's hand and lead him into the main chamber. Both of them would stand in huge dark chamber with seven massive power tubes, every one of them containing an angel from each timeline inside. 

"This is the power source of everything. Everything that we love is powered by angels even to this day... The hero rank is destined to protect them until death. I've lead countless unique people with dreams to this place, and I've watched each one of them die. I have lived for decades in this place, protecting, commanding, doing everything for the Holy Earth. I was exposed to your whole life story, the Holy Earth has been spying on you, but for a good reason. We believe you're the chosen one according to ancient manuscripts. I know, this isn't what you wanted, it wasn't written anywhere, and I know this is a lot to take in. That's why instead of just letting you go alone and command you from afar, I'll work with you, be with you."

"I don't think this is right."

"The ways Holy Earth chooses may be rancid, but you have to trust me. I knew it would come to this, that's why I went through the hard work of letting you even have a choice. You can choose to either comply and become a hero we desire, or reject and go back to your home."

"..."

"Please, do it for me and everyone."

"...I comply."
