Knock knock.

She knocked again, an odd politeness coming from her cold breath as she stood before the door looking down. Suddenly, a bump was felt on the door, someone was there. 
A shotgun was blasted at the door directly into Rila's head, the wooden door was shattered and Laura bust down the remains with a kick to continue confronting her. She fired again, swiftly reloaded and fired again, and again, all until she was out of ammo. She positioned the shotgun in her hands to crush Rila's head with the stock, but her body suddenly sprung into action and guarded herself as her mauled head regenerated back into its form.

Laura scoffed and spat on the floor, "ONLY YOU KNOCK THAT WAY." She continued to kick and slam at her with the stock of her weapon.

The lights flickered, in a flash she was suddenly standing across her. Her black blood dripped from the head all across the body, her jaw regenerating last. The lights flickered once more and Laura was punched all the way back to the interior of her apartment room. Laura slid under her tables to pick up her well prepared dispensable submachine guns, Rila flashed into her close distance and began to slash and slice splitting her surrounding furniture into pieces. Laura swiftly evaded with the submachine guns in her hands, once she saw an opportunity she decided to strike back by hitting the blunt side of her blade and sliding her hand all the way to up to Rila's chin to waste the whole magazine of ammo into her head. Laura knew however that it was not enough, so she hit the blade again with her other gun to knock it off her hands as she regenerated She swiftly picked it up and threw it out of her window from the thirtieth floor. 
Laura was always more superior than Emilia. Always better than her at everything, a self-centered woman who had it all, always mindlessly bragging. The single thought of her winning only spun her into a blind rage, her face was mauled again but as she regenerated her veins popped and extruded from her body. The black tendrils enveloped her arms, arose from the back, she grew twice in size. Her right eye blindly shined through the eyepatch with emotion, she was a beast, and Laura could only watch in horror as her old friend became a monster.

UNDERGROUND SYSTEM - CORE - YEAR 5696

"Hey, 'Mily, promise not to freak out about this."

"Ergh, what now?!"

"Take that pistol right there, aim it at me, and shoot!"

"Have you completely lost your mind???"

"Trust me, I just wanna get my endurance game up."

"Whatever dude, you better not bomb my entire reputation here."

*Gunshot*

"That tickled!"

"You are literally bleeding out!!!"

"Am I still standing? EXACTLY, I'm here straight up chillin' girl don't mind about no reputation here."

"HOW."

"My body goes freaky with a specific hormone, I'm practically immortal for like two minutes depending on the injury I sustain."

Rila slammed Laura against the cold wall of her room, the gooey black thick veins disgusting her. Laura gasped for breath, and with her reflex she began to claw on Rila's exterior skin. With an impulse Rila immediately slammed Laura against the wall again, however this time the room broke apart and sent both of them falling to the streets. Rila constantly tried to strike Laura with a final blow, but she only kept evading and fighting back. Rila extruded a thick web from her back and hands that stuck between buildings, Laura used this as an opportunity to climb upon them and pick up her main gun from the room, designed specifically for anomalous use. Rila noticed, immediately pulling back the web and jumping right after her. Laura picked up her weapon case and threw a hook with a strong zipline enough to get her into other buildings. She bought herself enough time to open up the case and swiftly build the rocket launcher, load the light-matter, and aim at the demon that was crawling on the walls of opposing buildings. Rila jumped right on the roof where she was at, Laura had to take the weapon with her two hands and fire as she walked backwards, evading. Laura closed her eyes forcing a slight tear to run from her face, and wished for her best as she fired the rocket.
The rocket flew, leaving a trail of sparkling stars as it directly hit Rila's chest. With a blinding light it exploded, absolutely decimating the top of the apartment building they brawled on. Light matter corrodes dark matter, and Rila looked down at her stomach that had a hole in it. She could not do anything about it, and fell over to the floor onto the rubble. Laura slowly walked throwing away the rocket launcher and brushing off the dust off of her shoulders. She leaned over to Rila, grabbing her head up by the hair.

"IT'S OVER, GIVE UP." She yelled. "YOU WANT TO HEAR THAT AGAIN?! GIVE UP!!!"

She stepped on her body and pulled out her other remaining submachine gun from her back. She held the gun with her two hands and wasted the whole magazine shooting at her head, letting out a guttural cry as she fired. Once the gun ran out of ammo, she fell onto her knees and looked at the mangled corpse of Rila. Tears streamed down her face but suddenly she broke out another rage and took the gun into her hands with the full intention of slamming it directly into her broken face again. Rila's arm suddenly bounced into action, suddenly catching a grip on Laura's forearm. Rila's immense strength immediately breaking and shattering her arm. Rila turned her broken face and looked at Laura, jawless, eyeless, lifeless, trying to say words.

"...You always go for the heart, darling."

In the blink of an eye she was back at her feet again, slowly regenerating her vital body parts. The black blood only continued to drip down. Laura was weakened, Rila caught her by the neck and lifted her in the air, she choked kicking and desperately trying to find a way out. It only amused Rila, she walked with her towards rubble, and began slamming her head first into the concrete. Laura screamed amongst the sound of bricks smashing, the blood splattered all across the floor, Rila soullessly looked at her dying body trying to do something as it was being tossed around and slammed into concrete. The screams have eventually faded, Rila held to her dead body, a face mutilated beyond recognition. She jumped off onto another building with her body in hand, tossing it onto the fresh white snow. Rila took the effort of turning her body upwards, laying in the snow like a proper corpse, and once she was done she laid next to it and started laughing maniacally. She erupted into laughter as the red dark blood of Laura flown through the clean white snow, Rila gripped onto her body as she hysterically laughed. Light tears flew from her eyes as she accidentally broke her body even more. She rolled in the snow, laughing.

"Auto, I have the feeling something terrible has just happened." Ferdinand spoke at the middle of the night, looking out at the glowing holy cityscape from a distance at the Core's balcony. "It's like as if a piece of me was suddenly taken from me and shattered."

"*Not a usual feeling...*" Auto took his time to think a little as he leaned at the fence, "*Perhaps* it may just be *your body* adapting to *angelic* matter..."

"Nothing bad has been happening, right?!" Ferdinand worryingly asked, "Rila has been gone for a week now without any response?!"

"*She* has been ordered for a *private mission*, knowing her she is gonna be *fine*." Auto reassured Ferdinand, "But if *your gauntlet does not agree*, only *time* will tell us."

Ferdinand looked back at the distant cityscape with strong sadness in his eyes, "I don't know what I'd do without her, Auto."
