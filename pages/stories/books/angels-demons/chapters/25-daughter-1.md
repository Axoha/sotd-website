Rila sat on the hospital bed, staring blankly into the ceiling with her mouth open. A clock ticked in the background, her mind was fuzzy, a static noise shook her nerves as she counted the dots. Researchers and doctors often came to visit to give her basic medication to swiftly heal her mental injury, but she could not stand the sight of her appointed people she had around since she was a young child. She often yelled, clawed, punched those people to get them away from herself.
Ferdinand walked rather depressed through the hallways upon the sudden rejection, he could not believe she'd say such a thing after everything that happened. Auto came out of another room and walked by Ferdinand discussing the last events.

"I don't get it, why would she say something like that?" Ferdinand rubbed his eyes and gestured with his hands, pouring his feelings upon Auto.

"Don't think *too deep* of it." He replied, "Her mind was just *wrecked* by the *Angel's light.*"

"Yeah but like... I don't know." He looked down, "How come the light didn't affect any of us?" Ferdinand questioned.

"Because we're *part Angel*." Auto scoffed, "I thought it was *obvious.*"

They silently walked together more.

"*Hey*, now that there is a time I really want to know more about the *Angel attack* you mentioned." Auto suddenly buzzed. "That *remark* and the *past events* completely *contradict my belief*, *I need to know more.*"

Ferdinand breathed in, "So I met this guy named Akimi, long crimson hair, white fur, thick headband covering one of his eyes. He helped me deal with my first shock, he later told me his story of how he once belonged in a 'Five-Hundred' something division together with an Emilia, my father Stanford, my mother Laura. Apparently an Angel attack happened during their breakup, which perfectly matched your description of a Guardian."

"I believe that's *all I need*." Auto hushed Ferdinand, he placed his hand on his shoulder, "*Thank you*, I must find out *more*."

"There wasn't anything left anyway." Ferdinand quickly replied.

"*Something* is very *odd* about this, I will report back to you if I find *anything.*" Auto swiftly walked further, "*Don't forget* you are visiting your *mother!*"

Ferdinand stared at Auto who was walking out of sight, "Bye..." He muttered.

Auto swiftly appeared from the room he just entered, "Ask *her* about *anything* related to *that*! It would *help a ton*!" He yelled from a distance, and he was gone again.

Rila.
Just who was she?
Her life begins as Emilia Jones, the daughter of an American family settled somewhere in Asia of an alternate world. She was a special child, creative, social, intuitive, always finding a way to get around problems her own way. Having a lot of friends, she has always been the star of any group. As time went on her talents slowly crumbled by age, her parents divorced and fell to addictions and mental problems, her family had to move and she had to adapt to newer environments. Everything was falling apart and she was only a child, begging her parents to be normal for once, not understanding of anything that was going on. Financial issues, young Emilia's slow failure in school, drug withdrawals, main elements of which caused her father to become abusive, but Emilia was adamant, despite the difficulties she set on becoming perfect. She studied endlessly, did everything to make her parents proud, even if they were usually unresponsive. Once the final results came in from her school, she cried tears of joy as she passed with excellence. She rushed through the murky streets of the city to reach her home, thinking that such result from academics would finally bring light to her family for once. Bouncing in joy, she reached her hand on the knob and opened the door. Her father, who was the only relative living with her was found dead by suicide.
The next few days for her were empty, living in her home alone in a mess. No one was there to clean the body, she was too afraid to even call somebody. Every time she would look at it she'd shiver, once trying to put up a blanket over it to hide it from her usual sight but even the imagination of the cover touching the decomposing body shook her. It smelled terribly, her home was uncomfortably moist, full of bugs crawling and flying around the body. Tucking and hugging herself in her bed, she'd constantly think of what's gonna happen next. She experienced countless nightmares of the rotting body standing behind next to her bed and staring, her heart beat fast with every breath she took. One day knocks were heard on the door, she hid under the blankets in her bed fearing what might come. The door gently opened, heavy-sounding footsteps sound and creaked on the wooden floor throughout the room. Emilia held tight to her pillows and stuffed toys, slightly breathing not to make too much noise. The footsteps came closer, and closer, until she felt a grip on her blanket. With a mechanical arm, the third Director looked at her with curiosity once he pulled the stained blankets off of her. Emilia was not familiar, the Directors face was covered with a screen, his body was mechanically modified, but despite such differences the Director slowly caressed her cheek, wiping away her tears.
Emilia was compliant with the agents, packing her things up, letting herself be guided by the third Director. She didn't speak a word, neither did they; They understood and respected her. The Director held her hand, she walked steadily behind him. Curious to where she was going, she mustered up the bravery to ask. 

"We are bringing you to a better, sacred place." He responded, unusually softly.

She travelled with the agents, through cars, through planes, through boats, until she was at the arctic. They gave her warm clothes, a big fluffy coat. They all boarded the train connected to an artificial string of existence.

"Why am I being taken away?" Young Emilia asked the Director, with a quiet voice.

"You did pass your classes with excellence, after all." He spoke back.

The train turned into pure energy, and Emilia watched the pink cosmos with awe. Observing all the details not even noticing she lacks a body, she looked, stared, imagined. Rila looked back at her from the other side of the cosmos, she asked her the following.

"Why are you making me relive my last fifty years of life."

Emilia turned around to her, "You need to reflect." And went back to observing the wonders of space.

Upon arrival at the Holy Earth, Emilia was flashed by the flashy golden skyscrapers, the wealth, the divine beauty, she wasn't used to clear weather. The Director and the agents took her to the core, where she was assigned a room. It was a spacious place with two beds, a counter, a small tv, all the necessities of a normal apartment room. A boy, the same age of Emilia slowly walked with wonder towards the new visitor. Both of them were unsocial, unable to properly express themselves for a greetings, but the kid eventually reached his hand out to Emilia.

With an awkward smile, he spout, "I'm Akimi, you are?"

Emilia struggled to affirm with the handshake, but after some tremble she complied. "I'm Emilia."

"You two will be living here from now until any changes are made." The third Director spoke, "A schedule will be appointed to both of you tomorrow."

And with that they left, the door was shut behind Emilia and she was left alone in the room with Akimi. Without much to say, she just glanced over at him and carried her bag to a bed. Placing it at the pillow, she laid down on the bed and looked up at the ceiling. A frown formed on her face, she sniffled, and lightly sobbed deep in her thought. Akimi noticed the behavior and stumbled upon her, thinking of a way of comforting her. 

"Do you play videogames?" He asked.

"No... I never got to." She rubbed her eyes.

"Would you want to?" He replied.

Emilia turned her head towards him, who looked back with big eyes. "Sure?"

Akimi softly grabbed her hand and brought her over to the small television screen they had in the room, surrounded by pillows to sit on. A retro console was connected to the screen, supposedly one of the things Akimi brought from his home. He pulled out a binder full of DVDs, and shuffled through games thinking of what she would like. Upon finding something special, he inserted the disc into the console and turned it on, also handing a controller to her. The screen flashed with an ethereal noise and chimes, frightening her a little. The screen transitioned into a black void, followed by sudden abstract shaped composed of tiny lines morphing in and out, until the opening music hit its climax and a catchy tune began to play. A familiar white bunny character appeared on the screen, dancing with the title "vib-ribbon" bouncing above it. Akimi navigated through the menu for her, until he turned on the tutorial.  She was glued onto the screen.

The bunny danced again, with a goofy song playing on the background, it skipped around on a single white string and sang. "La La La La - oh, what fun!"

"Whoops!" An obstacle appeared, the bunny leapt over it without any input. "That was close."

"vib-ribbon is a game where you press the buttons..." It continued to sing, "that match the sound-generated shapes!"

Suddenly, it crashed into an obstacle! "Aahhhhhhhhh!"

"This is what happens when you make a mistake!" The bunny vibrated heavily, until it transformed into a frog, and then a snake, gradually turning back into the bunny after some time. 

"No problem. You can still make it!" It happily continued to skip around, "vib-ribbon only uses 4 buttons. It's really simple!" The screen transitioned with a mess of lines, which morphed back into another scene.

"Press 'L' for blocks!"

"Press 'Down' for pits!"

"Press 'R' for loops!"

"Press 'X' for waves!"

Akimi looked at Emilia play, she was natural at this. After passing the tutorial she immediately navigated the menu to play a real level. Akimi was quite impressed, the screen transitioned back into darkness and a horizon formed with the little bunny on the far left frolicking joyfully. A cute song began to play and obstacles appeared. Emilia bopped her head, timing her jumps and moves just right. A circle of dots slowly formed around the bunny character, with every successful move it would look more full, until suddenly the bunny character turned into a queen with wings. Emilia smiled at the sight, and became more focused as the song and the character sped up. Move after move, she'd start playing more levels, she'd sink a whole day into this game without even knowing. Akimi smiled at Emilia absolutely gaming, he scoured through his binder thinking of what other games to play in the future with her.
