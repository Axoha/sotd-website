Days have passed since the operation reached its completion. The Bastion - losing it's main source of power and a vital chunk of it's capital city slowly rotted away. The Holy Earth's forces valiantly fought more, reclaiming the lost planets and exterminating every living remaining Bastioner, alongside any evidence that ever existed. Auto's power within the ranks was only temporary, exclusive to the operation, but the Seventh has granted him another two weeks for an experiment that would continue the script.
Auto spent every minute working hard, ensuring the machination would work without fail. He gathered a staff of Holy Earth's employers to help, the people rotated in and out every day for his constant work. Finally, without a break, without a sweat, he had constructed a machine that would allow him to see into the far depths of space and communicate with Angels, hidden within the fabric of existence. He'd proceed to invite only both Ferdinand and Rila for the first experiment.

Ferdinand's day began as usual. He woke up in a large comfy bed alongside sleeping Rila, dressed himself and went to make breakfast, checked the phone for any news, and went to roam the insides of the Core for anyone that needed help. Somedays he'd even go outside, sit on a bench at one of the landmark gardens left by the seven sacred angels and enjoy the views, sometimes even snacking the apples that grew from the big tree. It was a relaxing life, and finally getting an opportunity he planned a visit to his old home. Rila on the other hand lived her own life following orders from the directors all the time, she sometimes stopped by to bond further with Ferdinand, but something has always seemed off about her in the past month. Both of them took a day off for Auto's experiment and walked together to check what's up. Turns out Auto repurposed an entire Core's cannon into an observatory, which should allow anyone to see and transmit signals into places trillions of light years away.

"I'm *so glad* you people came!" Auto joyfully spoke, his voice was slanted once more. "I haven't slept for **DAYS**, this machine will *change the world as we know it.*" He excitedly yapped.

"Yeah, haven't seen you around in a fat while." Ferdinand scoffed, "What is this machine's purpose anyway? What changes will it bring?"

"Powered by my *heart*, this observatory should let us *speak to Angels*, even giving us an ability *to see them*!" He rubbed his hands, and began the start-up sequence for the supercomputer. He opened his chest to expose his heart and connected a tube to it, giving the machine enough power to start. 

Rila watched, unamused. Lights turned on in steps, bars were slowly filled, the machine roared. Ferdinand stared in awe contrary to her, the computer flashed with a sudden broadcast of what the massive telescope had in sight. The white strings of existence were visible on the screens, flowing, waving amongst the pink cosmos. It was a beautiful sight, but Rila stood still unmoving with crossed arms.

"The potential there is with *angelic matter*." Auto gasped, "In the next coming years of *peace* we can begin *another renaissance*, we can *unite with the Angels*, craft the *perfect world for everyone.*"

Auto slightly moved the telescope, zooming on in any interests. Suddenly, behind a thick string rose a glowing white orb. Auto slightly stumbled upon his equipment as he quickly zoomed in on it, without a doubt it was an Angel.

"It works!" He exclaimed, Ferdinand walked closer to the screen to watch, Rila's eyes have widened slightly. "That is a *Guardian Angel.*"

Ferdinand looked at Auto, confused, "What do you mean 'Guardian Angel'?"

"*Angels* are divided to *several roles*." Auto looked back with joy, "*Messengers* are those who inspect and send signs, *Guardians* are divine protectors sent to investigate anomalies, and *Supremes* are last resort giants formed to end any scenarios in an instant. *Of course*, there is a *lot more*, these are just the *most common roles*."

"Huh." Ferdinand thought, "Interesting."

"Guardians are pretty funny looking." Auto continued to examine the Angel, "They're *typical Angels* encased in a *massive shell that looks like an eye*, paired with *up to four to eight diamond shaped arms that can transform into anything destructive.* It is said they also bring *violent rainstorms* upon arrival, or *other natural disasters*."

Ferdinand thought to himself even more, proceeding to spurt out the following:

"I think I remember some red-haired guy telling me about an Angel attack that occurred around twenty years ago."

Both Rila and Auto slowly turned their heads at Ferdinand.

"What?" Ferdinand, unnerved, asked amidst the silence.

"Angels attacked this place!?" Auto confusingly buzzed.

"What do you mean you met a red-haired guy who knows that!?" Rila yelled out.

"Nah, *nah*." Auto raised his hand, "Tell us *EVERYTHING* you were told."

Rila crossed her arms and looked at Ferdinand with a mean stare, Ferdinand was nervous.

"Um..." He began to reminisce, "During my first few months after I ran away upon the completion of my first assigned mission I met a guy at the mountains. He offered me marshmallows, told me his story..."

"*WAIT.*" Auto yelled out, signaling a stop with his hand, the computer began to make beeping noises in Morse. The Angel was trying to communicate through his machine.

... - .- - . / -.-- --- ..- .-. / .--. .-. . ... . -. -.-. .

"State your presence." Auto read out the translation, he began to input signals as a response.

--- -... ... . .-. ...- .- - .. --- -. --..-- / ... - ..- -.. -.-- .-.-.- / .... --- .-.. -.-- / . .- .-. - .... .-.-.-

The room was silent, the beeping noises echoed through the space as everyone awaited a response.

There was no warning, the screen turned off and a holy ray of light emitted through the open tiles. It was blinding.

Rila found herself as a little kid in a dark room, she stood, looked around with wonder and curiosity. A door stood in front of her, she walked with her stubby legs and reached her hand onto the knob, opening it. It wasn't a room, it was a flash of all of her past fifty years, streaming down at an incomprehensible speed. All the actions, all the days, all the weeks, all the months, played in a second at a loop. She was scared, she closed the door and ran away. The floor beneath her cracked and shattered like glass, she fell through the void. She closed her eyes, wishing for this sudden intrusion to end, but upon impact she fell at the horror of her best friend's corpse of younger Akimi. She stared with despair in her eyes, covering her mouth before eventually throwing up. She swiftly turned back and continued running in fear, "SOMEBODY, *PLEASE*, HELP ME!" She screamed, but no one was there. Papers blanketed her path, full of incomprehensible text. At once, she bumped into one of the Directors, who stared back at her without emotion. She tried to run more but she was enclosed by the six Directors around her, she desperately tried clawing at the floor to somehow get out again, but nothing worked. Blood began to flow from her mouth, her nails were being scratched and torn apart as she continued to claw at the floor. She yelled and screamed, kicked her legs, but it was all for nothing.

The ray of light for Auto and Ferdinand was just a mere flash, after their ears stopped ringing they immediately looked back at Rila who was covering their face, hugging themselves tightly, screaming in intense pain. She was immediately taken out from the light and checked upon, she couldn't respond of course, her mind was being shattered by the Angel's light. She was rushed to be hospitalized immediately, the observatory was fried and broken.
A day later, Rila's intrusions stopped being severe and was left in a blank state. No one was sure what exactly happened. The next morning she woke up, exhausted, with a bandage over her head, Ferdinand quickly came to check up on her, but as soon as she saw him at the doors, she turned her head slowly to him and said.

"Get out of my sight."

In a raspy voice.
