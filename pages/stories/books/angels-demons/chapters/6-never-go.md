Rila kicked open the doors to the control room of the CORE. She walked towards the director as the personnel watched with curiosity. She'd be clothed in her black dress, her heels emanating a sound within each step that would echo throughout the space. She stood before the director, sharing eye contact bathed in the silence.

"I demand immediate answers as to what is going on!" With shouts, Rila was immensely frustrated at the ignorance of everyone.

"Patience, peace." The third director would finally step in to speak. "The operation script has changed, but don't fear, you still serve a great piece."

"Another revision? Sir, you can't leave me out of that information." She would calm, and become more confused.

"There wasn't a need for you to know, every piece is falling perfectly together." The director would lean closer to Rila and place his hand on her shoulder, "Operation Seven-Twenty will undergo as initially planned. Play by your role, and things will get really exciting soon."

Rila would step back, her face turned into a silent agreement. "Yes sir, I owe the greatest apology. For the Holy Earth, for everything." 

She'd bow and stand, the commander stared at her with judgment as she walked away. Rila would sit alone in the car, taking a minute to gather her thought before starting the engines. It was night, Ferdinand has gone missing since she has subdued him during the mission. No one knew but the Holy Earth, but she still had doubt. Whatever fate has reached him she couldn't care less for, she started her car and drove back to her apartment. It was silent, an unusual uncomforting silence. Rila opened the doors to her room just to see all of Ferdinand's stuff gone, the doors were unlocked to her surprise, and his keys laid still on the table. She'd put some frozen food into a microwave and walk outside to the balcony to smoke a cigarette. The CORE shined brightly like a burning star in the distance, a signal that the first day is over. Whatever would come next she had no idea, but she had faith and trust in those above her.

Ferdinand, stranded, packed with bags would endlessly walk across the barren wasteland. He'd settle in somewhere on the dry mountains near the CORE for the night. He was mute, silent, and terrified of what he had done. The images of what he saw left a mark on him, he'd shake as he scoured his bag for something to eat. 

"Hey, you there, need any help?" An unknown deep voice came over from the distance. From the deep dark, Ferdinand immediately closed his eyes and remained sat in despair. "Please... don't come close to me!"

The unknown figure came closer anyway and sat across him on the ground, he'd place a pile of sticks and ignite it using his finger, setting a nice little cozy campfire. "I have gone through just about the same."

His figure revealed by the light, it was a humanoid fox. He looked so aged, dirty, with clothes that seemed like weren't changed for a long time. A thick headband covered his forehead, with long washed crimson hair coming from the back of his head. He'd pull out another wooden stick and pierced an aged marshmallow to it to cook it at the campfire. 

"I'm not one of those rebels, or someone from the Holy Earth, I'm only a lone traveler. Want a piece?" The fox would offer him a stick and marshmallow. Ferdinand raised his eyes, briefly looking at the offer. He took it, but still refused to share eye contact.

"Thank you." He muttered from his arms.

"I've met many different people here in these mountains, but you don't look like you come from here." The fox would softly speak, "What happened to you?"

"I killed. I murdered. I came here to create inventions and progress. I was invited and fooled by her." He'd muffle to his arms.

"That 'her'? Sounds like her, probably hasn't changed in the last twenty years."

"...you know Rila?" He raised his head in confusion.

"A Rila? No, sorry."

Both of them would share a silent moment besides the campfire. Hovering their sticks with marshmallows pierced through them, slowly cooking and eating them as the night went on.

As Ferdinand got more comfortable, he'd finally ask, "Sir, what's your name?"

"Call me Akimi."

"Nice to meet you, Akimi. I'm-"

"Ferdinand, right?"

"How'd you-"

"Your collar, I recognize it. I used to work here at the Holy Earth with your parents and a girl. Stanford, Laura, and Emilia." Akimi would trance off a little, feeling nostalgic.

"My mom never really mentioned the Holy Earth outside of the incident and how this whole place looked like, it mesmerized younger me." He'd talk as he was chewing on his marshmallow.

"We used to primarily work as heroes, our little '522th Stealth Division'. The first mission shook me for a whole week, but then we fought more for a good cause, and we became an unstoppable force. Laura and Stanford were the love birds, but Emilia was always the odd one out. Me and Emilia, she had an interest for me." 

Ferdinand would listen closely as Akimi would ramble on about.

"Then the Angel attack happened, landing devastating strikes that would level each part of the city with its crystal shapeshifting arms. Your father, Stanford, fell a victim, and Emilia betrayed our whole cause. Only me and Laura were left of the group, and it only became a blur to me as time went on."

It would go silent, the marshmallows have ran out and they sat in silence across each other.

"You feeling better?" Akimi asked, "I don't have anything else on me to eat at the moment, sorry."

"Yeah, thank you."

"Ferdinand, listen to me carefully. You must leave this place and go back to your home. The only way out is through the train which you used to come here, you can only reach it with high-level access which you still have. Staying here will only hurt you more."

"I will." With might on his face.

"My time is running short, I wish I could've told you more." Akimi stood up and started coughing, "I'm only a spirit living in the mountains, my time is always so limited."

Ferdinand stood up, "So, is it a goodbye for the both of us?"

The sun slowly rose through the horizon, emanating a beautiful light across the land.

"I'm afraid yes, you must go."

Ferdinand only silently nodded with a slight smile on his face, "Thank you, again." He packed his things and began to walk away. Akimi watched and smiled too.

"One last thing."

"Huh?"

"Tell Laura that I'm well." 

Ferdinand looked with a surprise and confusion, but Akimi only watched with a smile. Ferdinand walked to the direction of the city, ready to come back home. 

Rila woke up, did her morning rituals, and set off to the CORE. Driving all alone she'd glance over at the sidewalks and spot Ferdinand walking all by himself. Impulsively reacting she turned her car and drifted, stopping her car and blocking the road. He was nowhere to be seen, Rilas' breaths were heavy. She'd collect her train of thought and get back on track. 
She sat on her spot at the conference, the directors and many other important roles sat and discussed the operation. It was another dark room, voices would echo whenever someone spoke, each sentence sounding like thunderstorms. 

"This operation requires impossible coincidence and luck in it's current state, we must revise once more." The first director began his speech, Director Xavier, the one who knows.

"There is not a need for revision, there is no such thing as coincidence or luck in this world." The second director spoke back, Director Kugi, the one that brings the Holy Earth to motion.

"We must carefully pick our choices, that cat is not as easy to persuade as we thought." The third director continued the speech, Director Diriel, the fist of the Holy Earth.

"The future is uncertain, and so is the present. The perfect child must work under our hands, we have to find him!" The fourth director spouts, Director Itarima, the eyes of the Holy Earth.

"Rilas' acts will determine the future, what happens now is the result of every action we took." The fifth director slithered, Director Om, the underground of life.

The whole conference meeting soon got very boring, and after it was over, everyone kneeled to the directors and left. Rila has had a gut feeling about Ferdinand despite trying not to care much, he could be anywhere. He would probably want to go home... His home.
Rila sat in her car and immediately drove off, right to the timeline-link station. 

Ferdinand stood still with his head down. He waited right besides the rail tracks, thinking. His acts were coming right up to him, everything he has done for the first month in the Holy Earth he thought about. It felt like a dream, it was already almost noon. A giant clock on a wall ticked, the sounds echoing through the silence at the empty station. He thought about the times he shared with Rila, most sweet.

She sped through the roads and traffic, quickly clumsily parking the second she arrived to the station. Rushing, running through the empty marble hallways of the station. She sighted Ferdinand once more, but he was quickly obscured by the train. She froze at the spot, and she felt the consequence finally set in. Ferdinand was gone, the whole operation was gone, everything was falling apart. 

The train departed, and Ferdinand was still standing still at his spot with his head down and a frown on his face.
