Gabriel and Auto sat together at the top of a skyscraper, their feet dangling miles above the streets of the Holy Earth. They talked, observed their surroundings, and ate cookies. The wind howled with strength and whistles.

"Your life doesn't make sense." Gabriel suddenly began to talk amidst the ambience.

"What do you *mean* by that?" Confused, Auto responded, "Living for *millennia* is not normal, but I don't *understand* why my experience would be *illogical*."

"Your reaction to the Angel's chamber contradicts your acts twenty years ago here, for example." He quietly talked.

"I do not *understand.*" He replied.

"Do you have no recollection of you being right by the side of the Seventh Director?" Gabriel tilted his head and asked.

Auto's eye widened, he shuddered, "No."

They both turned their heads to look at the horizons of the gilded city, Gabriel spent his time thinking.

Every day looked normal, yet, for some reason it felt like the end of the world was bound to happen soon. Unease grew in the populations due to recent events of Ferdinand confronting Rila in a fight, harshly damaging several buildings and streets. Reports occurred on civilians missing, as if they have just vanished into thin air for the past few months. Nothing was looking good, not for the leaders, not for the Directors. They were at a time of peace, without any substantial threat looming over them, but were those all just more fabricated lies to ignore the existence of the script?
Ferdinand, a week later was personally invited by the Seventh himself to watch an Opera. He arrived earlier before the show commenced during the night, dressed in a white suit laced with golden rims. As usual he'd be photographed and cheered for as he was a true hero among the people after all, but he was unresponsive, focused, expressionless, holding just a firm cold stare.

"*You have arrived right on time.*" The Seventh spoke right after Ferdinand passed the doors. It would be just both of them in an exclusive room, with two seats and a grand view at the stage.

"Why was I invited here." Ferdinand asked with a murmur.

"*You have been fighting crime, executing dissidents for days.*" He spoke, "*I thought you would enjoy some rest.*"

"I cannot rest." Ferdinand coldly replied.

The Opera began, a line of instruments were revealed and a performer walked up to the front. She began to sing, a beautiful melody echoed through the space. Everyone was seated silently, listening, looking, feeling emotion. The performer sang with their whole heart out, tears strolling down her face as she hit the highest notes. Ferdinand, despite such emotional performance, still remained the same, but he was focused nonetheless. Once the performance ended, claps roared through the crowd. The performer bowed and smiled, walking away shortly after for a break.

The Seventh looked to Ferdinand, who remained sat with a frown, "*Was that not magnificent?*" He asked.

"I suppose so." Ferdinand replied.

"*I have plans for the Holy Earth you may be interested in.*" The Seventh suddenly talked, instantly catching Ferdinand's interest. "*I may let you soak in your engineers' dream.*"

And with that, he unsheathed a screen to which he broadcasted blueprints on. Simply put - They were huge machines, labeled as 'SPEARs'.

"What am I looking at here." Ferdinand answered, not knowing the real purpose for the plan.

"*These are organic machines powered by our source to be piloted by a single person.*" The Seventh raised a finger, "*With this the Hero rank may finally be abolished, souls will be set free. A new system will be put in place.*"

Ferdinand observed the plans more, he began to slowly understand. A change like this would change everything regarding the military, less lives would be wasted this way. What he questioned, however, was how something like this didn't go through within the past three-thousand years before. He did notice flaws with the designs, and spouted some of his personal suggestions to the Seventh, who gladly accepted his speeches. The opera continued sooner and they both watched and listened again.

Meanwhile, somewhere far.

Ferd stood at the rooftop of the apartment building, he looked at the stars, the streets, with a frown. Emilia walked up and sat next to him. The Core emitted a strong beam of light for seemingly no clear reason, they both watched as the light reflected upon their eyes.

"Today is the last day, I know it." Ferd exclaimed, clutching his hand to his chest.

"W-what do you mean by that?" Struck with confusion, she asked.

"I can hear the distant voices of people, Angels disguised under a mask offering them to hold their hand." He continued, "Something terrible is bound to happen very, very soon."

"I was never told what would happen after you were born." Emilia talked, "Do you know?"

"No..." Ferd talked with tinted sadness, "If the worst comes, I will hold your hand."

"What does that term mean?" She asked more.

"Angels may be sent to pick a person to ascend into the unbound, a place above all." He murmured, "But I don't want to do that, I don't want to return there."

"Why not?" Curiosity consumed her more.

"Life that exists here is much more beautiful, the people here are full of emotions and soul." Little tears began to form around his eyes, "I don't want the Angels to destroy this world and begin anew! People should not have their lives cut short at the fault of a select bad people!"

His emotions broke out and he fell into Emilia's grasp, he cried in her shoulder. She comforted him with a tight warm hug, brushing over his back and head with her hand.
