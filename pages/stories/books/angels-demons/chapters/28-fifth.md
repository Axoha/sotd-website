Rila has finally awoken after a week of being in a coma. She swiftly looked around the hospital room, her breaths fast and sharp, it was night. She eventually calmed down however, tearing off any and all tubes connected to her. She casually got up, took her clothes, and went into a changing room to dress up, turning back into the usual Rila she was. 

"Yo, feeling any better?" Gabriel spoke to her as she walked down the hallways, acting like a good friend.

But she only walked by him, not even acknowledging his existence. He scoffed, "I didn't even want to learn more about you, anyway."

Rila's phone got notified, a warning was issued to her that she did not follow the script correctly. She was supposed to prevent Ferdinand from stepping out of the Holy Earth before the next crucial step, but she was not gonna be punished, it was easy to salvage this step of the script. An order was issued to her, the Directors not even giving her a break. She read the details and felt huge unease, but she knew there wasn't a choice to be made here. There was only one way she could force herself to complete the order, there was only one way to push away her identity. She walked down to the local bar at the Core and sat herself on a comfy stool. She ordered drinks, she drank them all, she ordered more, she would go on until she wouldn't even see. Unintentionally she would harass employers around, demanding "MORE." from the concerned workers. Each sip filled her with more uncontrolled emotion, her hands would morph into black sharp claws notably during slams. She played darts, hitting the targets only once, she raged more and threw tables. She laid down on the wooden floor staring directly into the warm lamp above her, forcefully sobbing like an utter maniac. She slowly turned more into a demon until she was just a cryptid of dark matter. She kicked and laughed rolling on the floor as she played her favorite songs, she sang her own karaoke's, she played a game of poker all by herself, by this point no one was in the bar anymore. 
Ferdinand laid on his bed in the room, he stared at the ceiling deep in thought. He framed a picture of his mother on a drawer and surrounded it with small, lit candles. He mourned, he regretted not coming by sooner, he regretted ever even stepping into the Holy Earth. Rila's rejection still held a grasp on his feelings to the point where he just felt numb. He couldn't get to cry tears, he couldn't get to say a proper goodbye, he couldn't do anything at all.

*Knock knock.*

A familiar knock was heard at the door, but he couldn't get himself out of the bed. The door eventually opened, and with it silently crawled a beast. He was oblivious to what was about to happen.
The Demon of Desire pushed Ferdinand further against the bed, in a sudden shock he tried to fight it off but it's grip was too strong. The Demon covered his eyes, his mouth, it tore off his shirt to reveal his chest. It's back extruded another arm, which formed into a sharp dagger. Stabbing him directly to his heart, he felt the shock and arched. His mind was invaded by its hand, psychologically cutting his golden arm off control. The Demon continued to extract a sample from his heart, his DNA, his core. Ferdinand kicked, his muffled noise struggled against its hand, but he was powerless. The dagger was abruptly taken out, his blood dripped down onto the floor staining the sheets of the bed. The Demon, upon taking off it's hand off of his eyes disappeared. Ferdinand's injury was quickly healed, but he could not recover the mental effect it had on him.

Rila stared at herself in a mirror.
She yelled with anger, she punched the glass, her knuckles bled out with black blood. She resorted to smashing her own head against the fractured mirror, the blood dripped down onto the sink, she began to tear off her skin, her eyes, her clothes, she was in total anguish.
But she blinked, and everything was okay. The mirror was fractured, the blood was gone, any injury she sustained was healed in a fraction of a second. Her inexpressive face reflected in the broken mirror. She was sick of her looks, she was sick of being Rila.
With slight peels she tore off her mask that clung around her face, revealing her dotted marks of the species she once was. She began to tear the mask on her whole body, her shaved dotted fur she had long forgotten. She slick her hair back and tied a ponytail that she used to love, and finally, she took of the eyepatch that covered her one hollow eye. She didn't exactly look like she did twenty years ago, but she still smiled at the reflection nonetheless. She felt good to finally be free, to stop being a Rila, but deep down she knew she'd have to wear the same stupid hairstyle again with the eyepatch again. She climbed to the roof of the Core where the wind was strong with howls. She laid down on the gravel and looked up to the stars, living as the Emilia she once used to be.

Auto reached the deepest level of the Core. He walked, his eye still being used as the light to guide him. Curiosity has completely overtaken him and now he has been looking for something more than the Angel attack. Oddly, the deepest level looked the exact same as what the Bastion housed, which worried Auto tremendously for what he was about to see.

"You have been following my directions? That's great, I was busy on the surface with stuff." Gabriel suddenly appeared from beneath a pillar and spoke.

Auto was already used to Gabriel's sudden and odd intrusions, "Tell me, what am I here *for*."

Gabriel took a moment to think, "The truth. I'll open the gates for you, but be ready."

He was not fond of that response, but he nodded anyway. Gabriel scanned his card and the gates immediately hissed and whooshed with alarms and metal. It slowly opened to the six massive chambers that housed each sacred angel in it's origin form. They were dormant, their hearts connected to wire that stole its blood each time it pumped. The sights flashed by Auto in an instant, and he fell onto his knees in complete despair. Gabriel looked at the chambers, he gave Auto a moment before helping him stand back up. Once he was standing, he grabbed his own Holy Earth's necklace with his trembling hands and tore it off, smashing it against the floor.

The next day arrived, Emilia was woken up by the harsh sunlight, somehow she had fallen asleep on the rooftop of the Core. With groans she put on her eyepatch and slicked her hair back to her default. She had to complete the Directors' order, and so she strutted the hallways with Ferdinand's sample in her hand. She took an elevator, sometimes staircases, into the deep levels of the Core. There were abandoned rooms specifically for fabrication using Angelic matter, oddly enough she was required to use these rooms as requested by the Directors. There was an empty giant chamber where she was ordered to place the sample at, scattered with red hairs that she didn't bother investigating into much. Upon placing both her and Ferdinand's samples she dusted off an old machine to began the fabrication sequence. There were loud whirrs, multitude of warnings before being able to press a button, and the muffled noise of a processor running. She affirmed to each warning without reading what the long paragraphs contained, she just wanted to get this order over with as fast as possible.
The chamber started with an ominous hum, the lights flickered, and a progress bar showed up on a screen of the machine. 

**1%**

Emilia stood behind the machine, patiently waiting wondering how much it'll take. 

Twenty minutes have passed, **2%.**

She sighed and sat behind the terminal, turning on her phone to see any news. She scrolled, scrolled, stretched, scrolled, laid down, napped, scrolled.

**57%**

It was going *somewhere*, there was no arguing that.

She laid down again and slept, until the chamber seemed to get obnoxiously fast and loud. She woke up with drowsy eyes and went to check on the progress bar.

"Are you my mother?" A quiet voice came by her right side.

She slowly turned with shock. There stood a little boy, with big eyes which of pupils glowed with a white dot, and with red marks that accompanied his white fuzzy fur.

"I- I-" Emilia stuttered, not able to speak a word.

"You must be. Our marks match, look." He pointed to his and her waists, which were both striped.

Before she could say anything in return, he felt the tight squeeze of the cat hugging her legs. "I was finally given the gift of life." He cried tears of joy, "I can finally experience what it truly means to exist!"

Emilia was bewildered, but despite the confusion she in her natural reflex slowly crouched down to hug him back, only to blink once and find herself in a completely different place.

"Every Angel loves this place, I can instantly see why!" He giggled, they were at the white plains covered with colorful flowers.

Emilia looked around, feeling the soft wind. The cat ran around until he suddenly stopped, running back to Emilia. He held her hand and suddenly they were back at the fabrication room.

"Mom, what *is* my name?" He asked.

Emilia turned around to see the label of the chamber blown by a black smudge, partially cutting a part of the text. "Ferd." She responded, "Ferd Ray."

"What an odd name..." He responded, "I'll take it!"

Emilia slowly smiled at the joy, but before she could gather her thought to comprehend the situation he held her hand again and brought her to different worlds in a span of a quick moment. "There is so much to see, so much to do."

He turned back to his mother, Emilia, "Thank you."

Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day  
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible said  
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today  
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day  
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day

While shepherds watch their flocks by night  
They see a bright new shining star  
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today  
And man will live forevermore because of Christmas Day

For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted  
"Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

Oh my Lord  
You sent Your son to save us  
Oh my Lord  
Your very self You gave us  
Oh my Lord  
That sin may not enslave us  
***And LOVE may reign once more***

Oh my Lord  
When in the crib they found Him  
Oh my Lord  
A golden halo crowned Him  
Oh my Lord  
They gathered all around Him  
To see Him and adore (this day will live forever)

Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)  
They had become to doubt You  
Oh my Lord (He is the truth forever)  
What did they know about You?  
Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)  
But they were lost without You  
They needed You so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)  
With the child's adoration  
Oh my lord (He is a personation)  
There came great jubilation  
Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)  
And full of admiration  
They realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord (oh praise the Lord)  
You sent Your son to save us  
Oh my Lord (this day will live forever)  
Your very self You gave us  
Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
