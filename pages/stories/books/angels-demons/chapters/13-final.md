Ravens flew above the smoke coming from the ruins of the collapsed city. Ferdinand ran through the ashes with short gasps, desperately trying to get out of the zone for his own safety. His own adrenaline has begun to run out and the sudden intense pain stroke him in the chest, he wrapped more cloth around his cuts to prevent losing more blood. The ravens watched with their eyes of darkness, judging and observing.
Rila walked back to the Core, going for her locker and putting on a thick coat. Her show was over but the mission was still in-progress. She turned to Auto, who looked back like a wondrous child.

Ferdinand managed to climb up the stairs with all of his strength up to a metro station, managing to ever so aboard a train. He dropped at the clean shiny interior of the train and rolled over to look up at the ceiling of the car, the white light blinded him but he only laid there and thought deeply as his adrenaline in his body has given up completely. He felt deep sadness in his heart, maybe the rebels were telling the truth, maybe he was abandoned to become another predecessor of the next. He hasn't seen the face of Rila in a long time, he missed the touch of her, her compliment, her praise. His long lamenting was suddenly cut by the sudden crash and steel thuds coming from several other cars of the train, he felt the need to get up, but he simply couldn't. He turned his head and looked out the windows, the gilded skyscrapers and the blue sky gave him peace - even just a little bit to his soul. The doors at the back of the car were held together and torn off by Antimov's own metal gauntlets. 

**

Back in his home, on a snowy night in the heart of New York lit up with the jolly red, green, and blue lights across. Ferdinand stumbled as he walked towards his apartment, clutching his body along the way. He takes the long elevator and walks the long hallway to a door.

Knock knock.

A woman talks to herself as she opens the door unknowingly, his mom, her son. There was a silent moment before Laura immediately tackled and hugged Ferdinand so tightly, they have comforted one another and eventually Ferdinand came into the dinner table for some nice tea and gingerbread cookies. Laura tended his injuries as he talked on about his whole stay at the Holy Earth. 

"I so knew I should not have just let you wander into that dangerous mess." She scoffed.

"Hey, I almost forgot to tell you." He spouted as he munched on the cookies, "I met this guy in dirty old clothes and stark long red hair, with some name like Akimbo."

"Akimi..." She'd softly say to herself, "His immortality plan worked, hasn't it?"

"He was just some sort of ghost." He sips a bit of his tea, "He says he's well, by the way."

"Of course he is, that little rascal." She takes a cookie and eats it in one bite, "By the way, you should really wake up and continue the good fight."

Rila stood at the corner of the room shrouded in darkness, coming out with her hands spread. "Please, do it for me."

Do it for them, the Holy Earth, and everyone that he has ever cared for in his life. Ferdinand felt the grip of his hands get tighter onto the table, unwillingly feeling himself stand up. He walked towards the woman, Rila.

Antimov stood right before him. He picked up Ferdinand by his arm and dragged him up on the roof of the train car. The wind was strong, the train was on the move, Antimov held Ferdinand above the ground by his arm. He barely had his eyes opened, the breeze comforting him as his long fur waved.

"You are too dangerous to be kept alive."

The lights on his head blinked with red, with a sudden grip he held firmly onto Ferdinand's shoulder and set his other hand to the end of his left wrist. He slowly tore his main arm off his body, slowly, agonizingly, the moment his body let go of the entire limb he was tossed onto the roof. His blood gushed across the train car, he writhed in pain, but Antimov only stood there with an emotionless expression.
A helicopter flew above the train high up in the sky, Rila and AUTO stood crouching and trying to see what the situation has come to with their magnifying glasses. Auto put his glass away and prepared his eye to become a remote camera.

He turned his head back to Rila, "*Lady*, the probability is not so *strong*. There is only *ONE* *good outcome* of the *hundreds*."

"This whole operation had always relied on luck." Rila started grinning widely, "We're here to create history, set the camera ASAP."

Auto nodded, he embedded his legs of wire onto the metal landing skid and hung from the helicopter with a perfect view on the current brawl. He brought his long lanky fingers and set up the advanced camera in his eye to begin the broadcast across Holy Earth.

Ferdinand crawled away from Antimov, who intimidated and mocked him for what he has become. It became a perfect setup for an execution, the audience suddenly watched the breaking news and covered their mouths watching the sudden breaking broadcast with horror. Time seemed to have slowed down for Ferdinand, he took his time to think about who he has become, what he has gone through. His breaths were ragged, he turned his body and looked up to the sunset, the world has gone gray.
Ferdinand Ray, the only child of ex-Holy Earth heroes Stanford and Laura Ray. A certainly odd individual since birth, a big intimidating boy with a fragile personality. Never came along with the other kids well, once retaliating against his bullies which turned into the worse for him. So unjust, so unfair, he was however a child with the greatest violent potential of all. He could resist anything you could throw at him, and he would always strike back harder in return. Expanding upon it didn't really work in his world, unfortunately there was simply no one like him. He picked up his interest in the Holy Earth and another interest for machinations, a spark lit inside him to invent, which has not worked out for him the best, either. Without his mother's conscience despite, his uselessness in everything for any career he chose to sign for the most elite he admired, Holy Earth - He was ultimately chosen. His mother didn't want him to leave for the Holy Earth, but he has already made his decision long ago, he left on a bad note, his mom heart broken behind.
The Holy Earth adopted his violent tendencies and he was born to become the greatest hero. Ferdinand Ray is a name you will remember.
He looked back down from the sky, the screens flashing on one skyscraper with his current situation. He looked across the cityscape and noticed he was being broadcast live. It has also caught Antimov off guard, but with that distraction Ferdinand took the time to stand up clutching his open wound from his missing left arm. His adrenaline has kicked back up, and he has never felt more alive.

"Antimov." He began to talk, "You should've torn off both of my arms."

Antimov leapt at Ferdinand with fury, but Ferdinand swiftly dodged him and took the opportunity to claw deep into his life support system on the back. Ferdinand's body should've given up due to blood loss or other causes, but something about the broadcast has sparked his fire to finish his final round. Antimov has started leaking excessive oil from all his machine prosthetics, desperately trying to gasp for air. Ferdinand ran to him and began throwing punches with his right fist, a consistent barrage and sweet revenge. Antimov tried to fight back, throwing his fists back at him, but Ferdinand stroke back with a massive uppercut and knocked him onto the roof before he could land any significant punches. He crushed his legs, his fists, and looked at his crippled body trying to breathe. There were no words exchanged, Ferdinand stood on his chest and looked at him before finally crushing his head with his feet. 
Ferdinand looked back at the cityscape, there was a beautiful sunset among the skyscrapers just barely peeking through. He saw his face across all the screens, his mind was in a thrill. He just smiled with light tears dropping down from his cheeks, he finally experienced a fair fight, and he finally became a true 'Hero'. He eventually fainted and dropped on the roof, to be extracted and treated right away.
