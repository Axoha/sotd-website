The trio were hidden in the trenches, the colossal machines just barely passing by. There wasn't any time to think, something must be done immediately before the Holy Earth's forces get trampled by the cold, heavy steel.

"Throw *ME* at the *Walker*." Auto buzzed out.

Ferdinand's eyes widened, "Are you absolutely sure?"

"And *YOU* follow behind, *of course*." Auto expressed with his hands, pointing at Rila and Ferdinand.

Ferdinand picked up Auto with his golden arm and set himself in a throwing stance. Auto zoomed in onto a walker and pointed at a hidden entrance somewhere around the legs. "Right there, *perfect*."

"Where?" Ferdinand, confused, stood still as he couldn't see as far as Auto.

"*Foolish.*" Auto smugly knocked, "At the *legs*, throw me *anywhere*."

A walker leg suddenly pierced through the ground in front of them, Ferdinand took a quick look at Auto before chucking him right into the femur. Auto, in air, deployed a hook from his body and swung beneath the torso, making a perfect entrance into the emergency door. He clung onto the tough steel with his fingers, leaving dents as he crawled. He found his desired entrance and drilled through the thick metal door, somehow mustering enough strength to rip apart the steel and leave a giant gaping hole. Ferdinand ran with Rila keeping track of the walker Auto was about to breach, their breaths heavy as the walkers' steps equated to a lot for them. The machines roared, continuing their parade trampling all the land beneath, there were only walkers everywhere. Suddenly, the walker they have been chasing stopped, waiting just for them to catch on. Ferdinand held Rila by his hand and charged his body, allowing him to jump high. He did not reach it, but he did manage to fabricate flashing tentacles from the knuckles of his golden arm that latched onto the main shell of the walker, allowing him to safely settle on one of the catwalks with Rila. The walker set on moving again, what unusual behavior.
Ferdinand tore off a steel plate and exposed an entrance, both of them ran throughout the slimy organic interior of the shell, the walls pulsing in a synchronized manner of a heartbeat. Green lights suddenly turned blue, a guide for the two to reach the pilot's chamber.

"I thought you would be here *sooner.*" Auto spoke, his eye obscured by a complicated technological machine.

"What's the big plan here? *(How does this machine even work..?)*" Ferdinand wondered and asked, his eyes gleaming towards the wires.

"*I have become one with the walker*. I'm *unsure* of the plan, for now I must *pretend* to be with the *army*." He murmured, seemingly focused.

"We'll get hit by an airstrike again!" Rila finally yelled. "Can't we simply not teleport onto a spacecraft using Ferdinand's *gauntlet?!*"

"If only it would be that *simple*, *inexperience is a curse*." Auto replied slowly and silently.

"What other option do we have?!" Rila's impatience began to rise, she expressed her frustration with hands.

"*Quiet.*" In a loudly silent tone, "*I must focus*, the *BIOS* changes and *checks the pilot* every *second.* I must remain *vigilant*. *Let me THINK*."

With the rising tension something had suddenly snapped inside the walker. A flatline noise emanated through the interior and the walker went dark. They have been spotted, and it was only a matter of time before the machine would be destroyed. Ferdinand and Rila were tossed to the side as Auto made a swift maneuver to evade a cannon strike from another walker. He dislodged a chunk of the shell, ejecting it from the main body before the walker was obliterated by another cannon strike. Auto threw the wired object off of his head and ran up to Ferdinand, grabbing his arm and dragging him along the floor. "We *must* get on another *walker,* quick."

Ferdinand, dizzy from all the ruckus, looked up to Auto, slowly coming to his sense amongst the chaos. He looked behind, Rila was nowhere to be seen, she was still stuck in the rubble of the ejected piece. Auto urged him to throw him again, but nothing could penetrate Ferdinand's blindness, he was locked onto Rila. A walker rose above the ejected shell and fired, exposing the whole interior - and Rila. She would live, Auto kept on yelling, but he leapt towards her anyway. The walkers recognized how much of a threat Rila is, it had switched into another weapon system that was intensely calculated as a guaranteed kill. Rila tried her hardest to free herself from the heavy steel, until she saw Ferdinand running towards her. The weapon system continued to charge up, its sound rising ominously. She tried to signal Ferdinand to stop and turn back by mouthing and using hands, but he reached her anyway and covered both himself and her with the golden arm. The sudden massive green laser beam hit with unforgiving force, Ferdinand's was not going to give up so easy. He stood in a defensive stance and held the shield together firmly, both of them being engulfed by the light. The heat was extreme, his gauntlet began cracking and melting but in return it reacted stronger than before. He clasped his hand onto the golden arm and yelled, the pain insufferable. The walker's weapon system has depleted, the light was clear. The field around was demolished. Rila was injured, she opened her eyes to see Ferdinand standing still. Charred, smoke coming from his fur, his gauntlet shook and vibrated while glowing red. Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred, and as soon as he opened up his fist a devastatingly powerful beam of light blasted from the palm of his hand. Aimed directly towards the walker, and many more walkers, whole rows of the army were sliced with ease in a short, blinding second. Ferdinand collapsed on all fours and took a moment to breathe as his body slowly healed. Rila was completely speechless, shocked, no word could describe her emotion. A Holy Earth's ship descended down upon the trio at the silent battlefield, presumably called by Rila. They boarded the ship and watched as both sides got reinforced simultaneously. "The things you do for that *girl...* How lucky you were not *erased* on the spot."

The ship flew above the Bastion's backlines, not having much time before being shot instantly. Auto and Ferdinand saw a Bastioner spacecraft to hijack, freshly spawned from a green rift.

"You, Auto, continue on without me." Her voice was raspy and weak.

Ferdinand was a bit disappointed, but they both nodded in response, bracing themselves for a jump. The second they were out of sight, Rila's body tore apart and she immediately vomit on the floor, using all of her strength to keep her body together until now.

Them both on the other hand finally got a hold a Bastioner spacecraft, Auto synchronized his body with the machine, precisely typing the exact coordinates of his home, to finally end his conflicts once and for all.
