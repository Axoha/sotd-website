Ferdinand and Rila, both relaxing under the warm light of the sun at a beach. Waves and the occasional wind flew by, both of them avoided the water as if their life depended on it. Ferdinand himself didn't know where he was, but it certainly wasn't the capital city. It was empty, likely private, secluded from society.

"There's so much to tell you when we come back to the CORE, how're you feeling?" Rila leaned towards Ferdinand, her shadow obscuring the light that was covering him.

"I'm just thinking now that we have an actual date to when I come back, it all feels so weird. Ever since that first mission - time went by so fast." He sighed, "I can't believe it's already October, this trip has cleansed my mind a bit but I still feel the need to return home."

"Hm." She observed him, "Want this apple I'm eating?" She took a bite off of the fresh apple and offered to Ferdinand.

"Yeah!!!" Mentally pouncing, with an excited yap.

"Wasn't that a nice trip?" She tilted her head with curiosity and a wide smile, both of them suddenly inside their room of the CORE. "I have to attend another conference meeting, I will be back soon."

"Yeah, yeah." He was in a complete trance, everything was moving so fast. He was still thinking about everything, one thing that was very important was his relationship with Rila. Their seclusion turned into a quick and cozy vacation on a sunny beach with the clearest of waters. His surprise encounter with Hano and Wall lightened him up inside, but Rila was all over his mind. The whole squad received only two spacy rooms at the CORE, with her of course being with Ferdinand again. He didn't mind it at all anymore though, they shared a room during the vacation too; It turned from being separated to lying on top of each other like stuffed animals. They cuddled, hugged, and all that other lovely stuff. 
She was constantly mentioning the upcoming training that awaited him at the CORE during the last days of the vacation, and right now was the time. A call rang out through his smartphone from her, and as he predicted it was about the training. He took his basic necessities and set off through the underground system.

"Today's a big day Ferdinand." She stood alone in a dimly lit room. Equipped with several weapons, a tactical belt holding them all. "I need to prepare you for the next missions." She spoke with a grim voice as her black silhouette cast his eyes.

Before Ferdinand had even time to say something, she swiftly grabbed her pistol and aimed. The gun only casting fear for the one second, a loud gunshot echoed as he was hit.
Blood spilled out, Ferdinand firmly gripped his wound and screamed with mute words. Rila walked towards him and crouched.

"W- Why?!" Finally getting his chance to speak, he looked at her with mixed emotion. Betrayal, anger, confusion, and sadness. His grip to his wound only tightened.

"That didn't hurt, or did it?" Rila tilted her head and a wide smile morphed onto her face. "The blood is dry, there was little to no pain, you live."

Ferdinand's' grip on his wound loosened and his hand dropped. She dug into his wound and took out the bullet, patching up his wound right after.

"...H- How...?!" He screamed, rubbing the dry blood off of his fur.

"There's a reason why the Holy Earth is all over you." She lent a hand to Ferdinand, "Those mutations which I have mentioned a long time ago, you in particular house a perfect combination."

"...W- Which is???" He looked at Rilas' hand and face with confusion and anger, his breathing was heavy.

"Your father possessed enhanced strength and size, your mother extreme levels of adrenaline. There are real reasons and explanations behind the first mission, we just haven't seen it and you don't remember."

Short silence occurred between the both of them, the space was empty.

"Don't ever shoot me again." He took her hand and stood up. "I'd rather do the boxing exercises you implied we'd do at the vacation."

"And that is exactly what we will do." She'd start wrapping her skinny hands and arms with tough bandages, "There's a new mission awaiting us in approximately 2 days, I just want to mentally prepare you."

He was shook after hearing that, without emotion he looked at Rila who stood close to his chest. She wrapped her arms around him and started spilling more words. 

"You will be shot, stabbed, sliced, mutilated, but you must continue to fight through for your desires. They have mutants too, our last encounter with the resistance was one of the luckier ones."

Ferdinand had no word, but might encompassed his face. He set onto a more determined mindset; there was something he wanted, something to give his life for. Rila soon handed him a pair of XXL boxing gloves, so big, like as if they were fabricated specifically for him

"I'm afraid I'll hurt you." He quietly murmured as he put on the gloves.

"You won't." She immediately spoke back to his surprise. "Throw the hardest punch you can muster, I want to see your fit."

Ferdinand gulped, uncertainty was clear on his face. He swung his arm, fist front, with flail tempo right into Rilas' face. She stood there smiling with hands hidden behind her back awaiting the hit. His fist was a mere inches away from her face, she gripped it in a quick second, holding his punch.

 Rila closed her eyes and shook her head. That's not how you do it."

She let go of his fist and Ferdinand stared with wide eyes, he felt a sense of mockery.

"You must be fast, try not to think." She slightly walked back, "We must also work on your body."

Ferdinand looked down on himself, he gazed upon his gloves. She held up her hands holding hard boxing targets and spoke, "Just do what comes natural."

He took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and nodded. One hefty punch slowly followed by another, increasing speed overtime. He knew how to throw punches, each hit reminding him of what he had done during his first mission. Occasionally they'd stop, Rila would get closer and teach him basic stances and strategies before continuing. Even more punches have been thrown, the next more aggressive than the last. The first hour of their training was already over and so they celebrated with a quick ten minute break. Ferdinand sat on the bench soaking wet, he took his soggy shirt off and sat there looking at the lights which dimly lit the spacious empty room.

"C'mon Ferdi, breaks over."

After what seemed more like ten seconds, he stood up with determination. Rila gave him a replica of his ballistic shield he had used during the first mission. She stood a long distance away from him dressed in her tactical suit.

"For the next hour I want you to not think of me as a friend, but rather as an enemy." The sentence echoed as she spouted loudly across the room while putting on her thick goggles. "Fend me off for long enough or make me unable to fight."

A sudden blank stare occurred, but he clenched his fists and readied for the exercise either way. Rila pounced off the floor and dashed straight towards Ferdinand, swiftly pulling her blade powered by the angels' electricity as she picked up speed. He stared in shock and horror, without swift thought he only cowered behind the shield mounted to his wrist. Impact was imminent, Rila swung her blade the moment she reached his distance. Ferdinand focused closely, he would parry Rilas' strike, but to his gaze the shield was cut in half completely. Awkward silence soon followed.

She slid and sat for a minute thinking, "During the next following missions we will be facing extremely lethal traitors, and yet I still can't believe they haven't engineered a proper shield for you." She looked to her back to where Ferdinand was standing, "It's like as if they wanted you to die, odd."

"W-what do you mean by that?" Confused, he walked closer to Rila.

"The Hero rank is designed just for experimental weapon and mutation usage. Every newbie gets something similar of scrap to work with, and based on how missions go they receive feedback on how to improve and approve for mass production. Death rate is off the charts, 'Heroes' are just fodder." She sighed, "You're incredibly important for the next Holy Earth's project, I'm disappointed that they're treating you like this."

"I kinda wish I didn't know that." He silently replied.

"Y'know, let's call it a day here. You know how to fight! I'll truly be behind your back this time." She'd look him in the eyes and raise her hand in the form of a fist.

"Sounds ok to me..." He'd comply and their fists would slightly clash, a fist bump!

Rila stood up, "I'd guide you to our room, but I have some unfinished business with the commander. Good luck!"

And before he knew it, she was already walking away waving her hand up as a goodbye. Instead of also walking away however, Ferdinand was dead set on improving. He gazed upon the closest and heaviest punching bag in the room. He has to complete his father's legacy, and he has to avenge the Holy Earth. The terrorist resistance only seemed as a pushover for him, he was more focused on the angel, he wanted it dead.

"Hey! There you are! Ol' glorious veteran who can't comply to my simple orders!" The commander happily greeted Rila who seemed agitated, she walked with loud thumps and sat herself on a comfy stool.

"I'm really not up for your lousy happy energy right now, commander."

"Call me Stella! I would love to become more personal with you." She'd flaunt her highly decorated long coat and adjust her hat before taking a seat next to her. "Anyway, what are you doing here?"

"Well I'd LOVE to know WHY Ferdinand's equipment is at the worst quality!" She would slowly, but aggressively face off Stella.

"Ah this one's gonna be for multiple drinks isn't it." She smugly replied, "There really has to be someone to update you on the current act."

"Tell me about it, maybe YOU could be the one!" She'd continue on with her aggressive comments.

Their chain of dialogue has been quickly interrupted by the bartender asking for what they want.

"One 'Demon Ale' please, thanks."

"So on the nose..." Stella scoffed to herself, "Vodka, please."

It turned silent between the two after that, there was only background noise of several other workers enjoying their time at the pub.

"I already am, you just constantly avoid me." Her tone turned a little more serious, "I would love to continue this petty drama between us but it cannot continue under this topic."

"Fine, whatever, fill me in, I'm all ears." With a frown on her face.

"Ferdinand needs to be near death at all times. It is a very risky new approach, but if we play the cards just right he'll come to be deadly, very deadly. Ascension of some sort, he is a special case and you know that." She'd fold her fingers as she waited for her drinks, "We'd have him out there even with just the bare minimum, it's kind of like how you share a demons strength with how much you sacrifice of your body, same concept here completely different results."

"Good to know, thanks. Could I be filled in with the future?"

"That is stuff we discuss privately, we could get onto that after the drinks." Stella smiled as she grabbed her bottle of vodka that conveniently just slid into her hands. "Cheers Rila."

Rila grabbed her ale, "Cheers commander."

They both sipped on their drinks, and time flew by, and time flew by, and time fainted.

*Sounds of lots of laughter, slamming, jolly music, and concerned workers.*

*"HOW'S IT GOING BETWEEN YOU AND FERDINAND???"*
