The air has started feeling crispier, leaves have been turning orange, so is the time of all hallows' eve. Citizens of the Holy Earth decorated and celebrated during the duration of October, carved pumpkins all around with funny faces but most importantly candles, representing each deceased loved one. Hano and Wall, unfamiliar with such traditions walked across the highly decorated spooky streets trying to find their way to the CORE. 

"You know, I really thought they would also give us something to traverse with." Hano spoke, "But I also do not mind the long walk."

"Gwahahuha" Wall would blabber on about as he sat on his shoulder, it observed the colorful decorations placed all around with its' two beady eyes.

"True, that is very true." Hano agreed.

Some more walking would ensue after. Right out of nowhere Wall started excitedly nonsensically hissing at a nearby store, 'Soulful Halloween'. Hano didn't want to go there as it was getting dark, but as usual Wall would plead its' way into agreement. Just barely squeezing through the entrance a spooky laughter sound effect played.

"Maybe I can get actual information here to figure what is going on." Muttering to himself, a little annoyed. His eyes quickly glanced at the costumes on the shelves. Everything was mostly the armor either the Soldier or Hero ranks use, and even his own armor was on sale. Though, in worse and cheap quality. Wall ran around like a little kid around the store, trying out different masks and fake blood.

Hano came up to the shopkeeper and looked down at them. "So, what is this whole deal with 'Halloween' around here?"

"That's funny, first time hearin' that question. People dress up and become spooky to scare the demons away, but it goes way deeper than that. Nowadays it's a fun tradition to do, popular mostly among kids, they go around trick or treatin' for candy."

"...Interesting."

"Oh by the way, that brand new hero costume is a perfect match for you! Any int-"

"You do not have to remind me, thank you."

Wall climbed back up on Hano's shoulder and they both walked away out of the store. Wall, splattered with blood all around would look at the confused shopkeeper dead in the eyes. He looked up after leaving the store to the sight of a massive screen blaring the average military advertisement, "Become a hero of tomorrow, enlist today!" 
Hano only looked with disappointment, his last mission bothered him as the months went by. The last time he had seen Ferdinand or Rila were back there, and his unsuccessful attempt at saving him was mind-wrecking. No one got proper information about the mission status outside of it just being "Secure, Completed." Everyone was forced to move into the CORE as well, though Ferdinand nor Rila still haven't been seen anywhere.

Wall leaned in closer, examined his feelings and spoke. "Something seems to bother you, you good?"

"It is just the common thing, I cannot get the guilt out of me for not saving him."

Wall dug up something from his bucket of sweets, chocolate. He hovered it right in front of Hano, "Eat this, I can't, it is very poisonous to me."

"From where did you even get that from?!-" He blankly stared with confusion.

Wall only put the chocolate slightly in Hanos' mouth, "Mystery..."

He reached his hand to get a hold of the chocolate, "Thank you I suppose." It tasted dark.

Ferdinand walks into the judgment room, a round parade of chairs on which the directors sat all together. As usual it was dark with a single spotlight lighting up the center of the room. The floor was made of gilded marble, he looked at the reflection and only saw a shadow of himself. 

"Ferdinand, Ferdinand. Your actions were out of our calculations, what has incited you to leave?"

"My purpose here is wrong, this is not the life which I strive to live for. I want to know the truth, I want to know the answer as to why I was chosen."

"We will come clear to you, we will comply to your wishes."

"Laura and Stanford Ray, love has struck them. They posed great mutations which would end with combining and multiplying inside you."

"Your purpose here is right, ever since the day the Holy Earth cowered on its' knees we composed a special operation."

"Operation Seven-Twenty, the 720th recorded Guardian Angel that wrecked the golden cities of our Holy Earth became mortally wounded and disappeared."

"It is certain it will come back soon, you became our only hope as you are the perfect child."

"Listen and do what we say, we must not let this world come to an end."

It was all slowly starting to make sense for him. 
The Angel will return, and with it shall bring War, Pestilence, Famine, and Death.
He would avenge his fathers' death, he would save humanity.

"What happens now?"

"Ferdinand, you will be secluded with Rila for the time being. Grant it as a vacation as you so wish, we must ensure our new plans do not fail."

-- *INTERMISSION OVER* --

Hano and Wall finally came back to their private room at the CORE. He started lighting orange candles inside to represent his deceased friends and loved ones. Wall stared at the fire with awe, the light reflecting from its eyes. There were a total of ten candles, one for his mother, another for his father, two more for his brothers, and the remaining six for his friends counting Rila and Ferdinand. Hano glanced over to Wall after a silent minute of looking at the fire to the sight of a mess, it made itself a pumpkin helmet. Both of them would share a quick laugh before returning to silence.

"I have learned a lot of new things today Walliem, I would love to have celebrated such traditions back at my home." He'd sigh positively, "You should probably wash that blood off before you scare even more people into thinking you are a walking corpse."

"Bah." It started to brush its face with its stubby little hands, arguably making an even bigger mess around but somehow cleaning its face. Wall proceeded to immediately pour his bucket of sweets onto the table, there was a lot, an entire mountain of colorful edible weirdness. It'd start quickly sorting out the sweets by what was chocolate and what wasn't. It also got a two small pieces of paper and a thick black marker, it labeled both piles as 'Wall's Loot' and 'Hano Tax'. 

"Are you gonna keep some of those other sweets for me?" He chuckled as he looked at both piles and labels.

Wall only shook his head in disagreement with closed eyes.

"Fair, you earned it."

The room would go back to silence, only the sounds of chewing, crunching, and tapping on phone screens were heard. Wall threw some sweets in the air and gobbled them up like a dog, while Hano held some chocolate bar in his other hand while scrolling through something on his phone. Their true moment of peace would soon be disturbed, loud classical-style music suddenly started banging from another room. Hano stood up to examine and Wall followed right besides him. He knocked on the door on multiple occasions but to no response, he opened the door to a sight no one would believe. Ferdinand and Rila, privately romantically dancing together dressed in the fanciest clothing. Bound together like match-made strings, their dances and joy soon turned into wide-eye stares. Ferdinand, Wall, and Hano looked at each other with lots of surprise and rushed together for a group hug. Despite not knowing each other too well yet, their connections were real and cherished. Rila looked at them with an unamused stare, but eventually it turned into her normal wide smile and she'd join in.
