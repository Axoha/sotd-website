"You seemed pretty tensed up for the past few hours, may I ask, what's actually going on here?" Ferdinand asked. He has sat on the steel floor for a long time by now, in a chamber of organic walls lit up by a faint, green light from the ceiling. There was no noise, only Auto's occasional movement could've been slightly heard.

"We must cripple *The Bastion*. They *cannot* continue, my *assumptions* were *correct*, they were *correct.*" His chest heaved, with ragged breaths.

"I get that, but like, something seems off about both you and Rila. You always only give me orders, explain important subjects on surface level, and more. I feel like everyone's hiding secrets around me and it's making me a bit paranoid." Ferdinand continued his speech, "I understand that questioning what the Holy Earth does is against the code, but I need to know how the directors have entrusted you so much, giving you such high permissions so soon."

"You are my *friend*, after all." Auto buzzed, "*The Bastion* has reached the point of *Angelic Warfare*. *Three-Thousand* years ago after the first ever *Angel Attack*, the Bastioner who had *absorbed* the Angel's power was gravely injured upon returning to home. He was urgently taken through an immediate *recovery procedure* and wired in a chamber *to be studied*. I was created in a series of Bastioners to study the Angels, to decode their powers and the ability to create anything from surrounding energy, painted in a unique white and blue scheme. *It is art, the Angels are artists who bring life into everything we see with their blood*, but the *Bastion begged only for war*, *for revenge, to spread mindless colonization*. If they ever mastered the power of this *Creation*, they would know how to *multiply* and take over all that exists, *which is happening*. *My attempt at sabotaging my life's study only delayed the inevitable.*"

"I understand." Ferdinandly quietly replied, but before he could continue speaking he was interrupted.

"*Ferdinand, I feel the same about you.*"

"What do you mean by that?" He asked.

"You could be *hiding something important with Rila*, just one *assumption* among many others."

"Fair." Ferdinand responded swiftly, unwilling to share all the details of him if need be.

The spacecraft seemed to have slowed down by a lot. Ferdinand raised his head and looked around mostly at the ceiling. The light flickered, and a projection of Auto's vision was broadcast to Ferdinand in the room. "We're *here.*"
The spacecraft descended down onto a black city that seemed to have never end, following in a trail of thousands of other spacecraft, behind and front. A colossal pyramid stood at the city's heart, with what seemed to be a green sun covering the tip of the sacred triangle. The titan walkers walked through the streets, checking on the towers with its searchlights in the dark, colorless city of shadow and green. The sky was only a green cosmos, with the sun being the only source of light.

"This is *𒑚𒁀𒐕𒋻𒐖𒆸𐎏𒐕𒋻*. There is no name in *your language* for this *unholy wretched place*, other than my *'Place of Sorrows and Fear'*. This city was built *millions of years ago*, at the very edge of reality *as many assume*. At any moment if *we do something out of order*, we will *die instantly*." Auto spoke in a serious deep tone.

"This place looks just like the Holy Earth but without its light..." Ferdinand softly spoke as he stared closely at the broadcast.

"That is *WHY* we must do something *that is OUT of OUT OF ORDER.*" 

Auto's voice grew more agitated, Ferdinand felt the ship suddenly gain a lot of speed, tossing him lightly to the back. "ON IMPACT, FOLLOW AND PROTECT ME, DO NOTHING ELSE." 
Unusually, his voice didn't seem so slanted anymore.

Ferdinand looked with wide eyes, unknowing to what's coming after the broadcast was abruptly stopped. He opened his mouth to yell something out, but before he could, the ship simply gained more speed. The spacecraft was set to collide into the pyramid, going over jet speeds flaring and evading incoming fire. Alarms have sounded beneath, every meter of a Bastioner's weaponry was used to prevent the inevitable. A second before the impact, Auto tore off the controller off of his head and crossed his arms. The spacecraft crashed into the chest of the pyramid, in a giant explosion leaving behind tons of smoke lingering in the air. Auto, uninjured, somehow protected by a shield grabbed the arm of Ferdinand who was frantically looking around confused, also uninjured. "STAY BEHIND, PROTECT AND KEEP UP." Auto loudly buzzed as he leapt at the turrets and cameras in the hallways, instantly tearing them off with a strong force in his hands. Ferdinand decided to just nod as he quickly began to understand what was going on, he generated a shield that would cover both him and Auto. With a fist full of might Auto punched through what seemed to be a power generator to open the sealed thick gate to the deeper levels. The lights turned from red to green, and all the gates have opened. There wasn't anytime to look around, Auto and Ferdinand ran off to the next spacious massive hallway.

"WHAT IS GOING ON?!?!" Ferdinand finally yelled.

"WE'RE GOING TO THE DEEPEST LEVEL TO DESTROY THEIR NEW SUPER-WEAPON, DUH." Auto smugly - but loudly yelled back.

The metal gates have suddenly slammed shut in front of them, Auto had no choice but to find another power generator to manipulate the system into unlocking all the levels. Turrets swiftly awakened with a loud beep and opened fire from any and all angles. Ferdinand valiantly held his position and deflected any strikes with his generated shield, Auto on the other hand crawling on a wall pointed his palm directly to an incoming laser strike and braced himself for a burn. The turret fired, but he had absorbed all that energy into his palm and released back at it, and many other turrets in the room. Little explosions emanated through the closed hallway, and Ferdinand looked at Auto with a confused, but exhilarated feel.

"How did you do that?!" He asked.

In return he only quickly buzzed. "I was inspired."

Auto penetrated the power generator and opened the gates, again. He ran swiftly left, right, the pyramid was a maze, his sudden speed made it difficult for Ferdinand to keep up. Green slices appeared on the walls, which would explode a second later, and hordes of Bastioners came through eager to stop the duo. The gates slammed shut again with a loud crash, they both found each other in a loop of endlessly destroying the turrets and opening the gates. A green slice cut through the gate behind them, and with an explosion and lots of smoke a walker pierced through, already having its third weapon charged. It fired with a whirr, the giant laser beam melting through the gates, the floor, the walls, the ceiling. Soon after more massive laser beams melted through the walls, walkers stood outside the pyramid firing at the duo.

"Throw me into the eye." Auto suddenly exclaimed.

Ferdinand looked around, the slow thick lasers entrapping them got him to only nod in agreement. He picked up Auto with his golden arm and forcefully threw him into the walker's eye. Auto pierced right through, the walker stepped back from the impact and struggled with the sudden parasite, it's systems blinking and failing. Auto tore off a hidden entrance from the walker's leg and leapt out from the explosion that would soon follow. Ferdinand nodded again in approval as Auto zoomed right past him into the deeper levels. The pyramids systems were destroyed, the Bastion desperately continued to gather more walkers to fire into the building to terminate Ferdinand and Auto. They had to continuously evade the sudden strikes, but the holes that were melted through proved as a quick shortcut. Sending in more Bastioners would not be worthy, as only the walkers had a slim chance of stopping them.
The duo have finally reached the lowest level of the pyramid, to Ferdinand's surprise it was just a steel platform in a spacious massive room. Things seemed to have calmed down by a lot, and Ferdinand finally gathered the time to muster up some questions.

"Yo, since *WHEN* could you do all that?" Ferdinand asked with the peak of his curiosity and confusion.

"I created tech for the Angel, I cared for the Angel, my body was specifically built to emulate and be as compatible as possible with him." Auto responded, using force to flip a switch to send the platform downwards slowly.

"I suppose that makes somewhat sense." Ferdinand stared. "I thought we were already at the lowest level of this 'pyramid'? Why are we still going down?"

"We are going into the lowest levels of the Bastion itself."

A moment of silence followed shortly after, the sound of the metal screeching against the walls was the only thing heard.

"My mind it not set straight at the moment, I am sorry." Auto looked down, and sat resting his elbows on his knees.

Ferdinand also sat and rest himself for a bit, "It's cool with me, all I need is orders anyway to get through."

"There is a lot that I want to tell you at the lowest levels, but it cripples my mind thinking of it. I hate the truth, the reality." He continued to softly speak.

"Whatever comes next, I will always stand alongside you." Ferdinand joyfully replied.

Auto looked up at Ferdinand. With wide eyes he felt a bit relieved, he raised his hand to speak, but without a warning sudden strong rumbles shook the area from beneath. A massive beam of light penetrated through the middle of the platform, continuously going on with a high-pitched screech until it disappeared, leaving behind a gaping hole. A second sun grew above the duo's heads, a figure of a Bastioner with it's four arms extruded four wings from its back and screamed as if it was in extreme pain. It reached out one of it's arms and fabricated a long, golden spear. The platform slowly gained more speed downwards until it was in total free-fall, and in an event that happened in a blink they crashed right into the lowest level. Auto quickly scrambled rubble off of him and immediately ran up to Ferdinand, both of them uninjured due to protective shields.

"We have come at the right time, *THE WORST STAGE OF ANGELIC WARFARE IS HAPPENING!!!*" Auto loudly exclaimed in a rush, but took a second to realize Ferdinand doesn't understand, "*BASTIONERS HAVE FULLY DECODED THE ANGEL, THEY CAN NOW ABSORB HIS POWERS.*"

Ferdinand, dusty, coughed up a bit of blood, "So we're gonna fight an army of angels."

"I'm afraid so." Auto looked down, "We must swiftly move, the Bastioner has lost us for now."
