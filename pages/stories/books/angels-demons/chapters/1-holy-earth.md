"FINALLY! I get to visit the Holy place after studying and sacrificing my whole YOUTH to get here! I was invited immediately right after getting my master's degree... which is really odd, but also really GOOD!!! Tomorrow I'll be going on a long travel across space and I'll finally get to see civilization at its peak!!! The Angels! The Celebrities! Th -"
After attempting to write more, he soon realizes his pen just ran out of ink. Ferdinand scoffs, he closes his journal and puts it in the bag. After packing his things for the big day he walked over to his mom, who he came to visit after graduating a month ago.

"Are you sure about this?" 

She asked with a concerning tone in her voice. 

"Of course mom. There's nothing to worry about, this was my dream ever since I was a little kid! I spent my entire life yearning and studying just to even step foot into this place! I'm an adult, I believe I can make my own decisions for my life." Ferdinand argued.

"It's a choice I can't let you make." His mom spoke back, "I left that place a long time ago for a good reason."

"You never told me what the reason was!" Ferdinand argued more, "It doesn't make sense! The Holy Earth is the peak of society! Why should we suffer and waste our whole lives at the bottom slaving away when we could live more comfortable lives at the top?"

His mom stood and looked up to his giant son with an expression of sorrow. She reached her hand to caress his cheek.

"It always ends like this, doesn't it?" She exclaimed, "We always argue about this same topic yet I can never break your stubbornness."

Ferdinand rest his hand on her arm and looked down in response, without a word.

"Maybe I should just accept it." She continued, "It has been well over twenty years, I should let go of the past and let you live the life you wished for so long."

"Don't worry... I will come back to visit often, even if it'll be a long gap in time."

Sadness swiftly overtakes him, which is quickly reverted by his mom taking a sandal and slapping his butt with it. "YEOWCH!"

"Don't be sad boy! Make your dreams come true. You have a big day ahead of yourself, brush your teeth and go to bed early!!!"

"Jeez okay..." Ferdinand replies as he looks at mom with an emotion that cannot be easily explained, but deep within himself he feels relieved that all those built up emotions were vanquished. He proceeds to take care of himself, and then threw himself into the bed at an egregiously early time.

"I wish I could spend more time with her." He thought to himself.

The next morning has arrived and Ferdinand had barely slept at all. He spent the whole night overthinking every single detail, rolling around his bed, too warm and too cold. The second he spotted the breakfast with his drowsy eyes that his loving mom made for him, he sat down, and quite literally devoured the whole meal in a minute. He would proceed to drink all the coffee in the cup in one gulp, later standing up, and saying the following:

"Thanks mom."

"Maybe I was wrong about you growing up! This was a new record at this age." Ferdinand's mom jokingly laughed. "You're also starting to get chubbier, I might have to pack some weights as well!" She'd also point at Ferdinand's chubby belly, still laughing.

"Come on mom, not now!" He'd blush and awkwardly laugh it off, immediately strolling back into his room to get all his luggage. After gathering everything important he has packed for this day, his mom stopped him right before going outside:

"Don't forget to put on a shirt!!!" She grabbed his arm which was already reaching for the door knob.

Ferdinand looked at himself, immediately realizing and thanking his mom for not doing the same mistake he always does. He put on a lousy embarrassing shirt, something his mom brought from the Holy Earth a really long time ago. He took a deep breath, shared his goodbyes with his mom, and stepped outside to see a black car with fancily dressed people awaiting him. Halfway through his slow walk towards the car, his mom ran up to him again and stopped him; holding what seemed to be a collar with a golden emblem with the letter "F" engraved in it.

"It's something your father wanted you to wear if you'd ever step into the holy earth." She said.

Ferdinand looked at his mom with a smile, he took the collar and put it around his neck. He crouched and hugged his mom, both of them sharing a long moment. A loud car honk would be heard as impatience struck the people in the car, eager for this emotional moment to end. Ferdinand would look back at the car knowing he has to go right now, he kissed his mom on the cheek and said their true goodbyes. He'd sit in the car after putting all his luggage in the trunk. He'd look at his mom, who's looking at him with a melancholic smile. They waved to each other through the glass once more as the car departs; he felt deep sadness growing inside him as he looked back at mom, waving until they couldn't see each other.
His travel to the Holy Earth was quite hellish, especially with the awkward fact he'd be accompanied by two agents. Ferdinand would often try to lighten up the mood by sparking up a conversation in the car, but the agents left nothing but a cold stare covered with their black glasses back at him. He'd instead look outside at his city that he was about to leave, New York. Beautiful giant skyscrapers menacingly looming in the skies, water that glistened by the sun, and the green shrubbery surrounding the long road; all accompanied with the vibrant cloudy sky and the sun rising. Suddenly feeling a huge spark of inspiration he'd take out his journal and start drawing a tribute to his final moments in New York. Carefully outlining his finished sketch, the car bumps onto a rock and the pen explodes against the paper, getting ink all over the place. The agents with their glossy glasses would look at Ferdinand through the rear-view mirror, sharing awkward stares and silence for a long while. 
They finally arrived at the airport. Ferdinand immediately asked to clean the interior of the car after getting out but the agents just looked at him, already walking towards the airport. They went past many different areas and later they finally got to the last sector, where they waited for their flight. Ferdinand opened his mouth about to ask a question, but rather quickly decided to stay silent. They sat there in silence, maybe for over 2 hours. While they were politely sitting on a bench in front of their waiting area, Ferdinand couldn't help but feel so amazed and confused by whatever technology the agents had with them. Thin and sleek black objects that would interact with every single touch by your own fingers, emanating vibrant lights and colors. He took out his stained journal and began writing with a backup pen. Dramatically illustrating his surroundings, the objects he saw, his rush of thoughts, until his brain process was quickly halted by the flight finally being ready. They buckled their seats as their unique small plane got ready for takeoff. Ferdinand went through his bag to see if he packed any other entertainment for himself other than the journal for the flight, but instead he found a small paper sheet with a long very unformal message written on it in between the invitation to Holy Earth.

"Hey! My name... is RILA yes! I have personally invited you to the Holy Earth, because of my deep interest in you your works! Yes even deep interest in you! Your physical capabilities outweigh a lot of us (not a fat joke). Your journey to this majestic place will be accompanied by two agents who by our rules cannot talk to you. You'll go through an airport, then to the arctic (hope you brought warm clothes!), then to the something I like to call 'TIME EXPRESS', yes! Is your first time travelling through reality, if yes you'll be super sick haha! The time express is a network of artificial lines all connected to our Holy Earth, but you know the details!!! You're a #1 HOLY EARTH fanatic that when I got to your records I almost SWORE and you know, in this world you get FINED FOR THAT. See you soon big guy."

Ferdinand could physically feel himself recoil upon reading some parts of the message, what was this mysterious figure thinking? Are they someone he knows? Despite the mixed feelings he gently put the message on the last page of his journal and closed it. 
Time would go on, the travel would continue throughout the cold icebergs of the arctic. This location was specifically chosen to align with the Earth's axis of course! The Holy Earth has constructed thousands of connections across most planets, those which can be traversed through a special train designed to withstand the 4th dimension. Invisible rays of light, like strings, the train activates and turns into pure energy that quickly travels through the connection strings. Similar to storage data and computers, we're all little bytes! Oh that's a really beautiful pink nebula out there, those white strings represent timelines right? They are barely visible! Oh what a disappointment. I'm talking to myself right? It feels like as if my thoughts are out there physically within grasp but not just for me. Is this what it feels like? Where am I? I was hoping I'd sleep but I don't have my body! I can only see images, memories, the pink space, am I stuck in my mind? 

"CONNECTION - 20A - FINAL DESTINATION REACHED - WELCOME TO THE HOLY EARTH"
Ferdinand finally awakes sitting on his spot in the train, unable to move, unable to speak, his mind in a complete trance. Like a zombie, he tries his best walking out of the train with the 2 agents supporting him. Ferdinand's grasp on reality continues to fix itself slowly, looking at others of different species out of curiosity. The agents finally let him go and leave him be when they finally reached the pick-up location. Ferdinand stares at the crowd looking for the mysterious person with a sign saying his name, oh, she's up there. A skinny, really tall bear lady dressed in black stands on the far left side of the crowd holding a sign with his name sloppily written on it; "Feeerd". This guy unfortunately had no idea how exactly the system here works, but his senses were fully up. He smiled and waved at the bear lady, approaching her. 

"FINALLY! I get to meet you in person after all this time! My name's Rila..." 

She extends her long hand to Ferdinand for a handshake, but he stares at her and his body shuts down, suddenly sleeping.
