-- *INTERMISSION* --

**Now playing: AA-REC-720 "Dreams" 5719, 14th January**

*Leaves rustling, distant city noises, crickets chirping*

"*Ferdinand*, can I tell you about my _dream?_"

"Sure! Go ahead, I'm curious."

"I want us to _ascend_, to become _Angels_. To fly beyond the _stars_, bringing _light_ to those in _darkness_."

"But isn't that what we are already?"

"*Not yet.* At least not you."

"Will I ever reach such state?"

"*Soon, probably*. I am *trying* to do *as much as possible* with my *director's rank* that is ending *in a week*."

"I'm hoping you aren't planning another insane trip through hordes of incomprehensible horrors?"

"*Haha*, don't worry. *The Bastion* has fallen. I'll be conducting *a huge experiment*, *you and Rila* can join in."

"Damn, really? Of course I'll be there!"

"I've always *wondered* about the *lack of Angels within the Holy Earth*, you'd think that *an empire that was given as a gift by them* would have *Angels* around."

"You have a point."

_It would be a bit silent after that exchange_

"I almost forgot to ask, what is your *dream*?"

"That's a tough question, I already have everything that I ever wanted."

"Is there really *nothing* you aspire for in the *future?*"

"No... maybe I could come back to my old dreams of becoming an inventor, especially with how the gauntlet can fabricate things out of thin air!"

"*True!* You can help me invent *thingamajigs* to *shock the world??*"

"...That sounds fun actually."

"After I *conduct the experiment* we will see, we're *currently at a time of peace* so anything is possible."

"Oh... It'll have to wait a bit more, I have a vacation scheduled for next week. I'll be finally coming back to my old home, to visit mom."

"That is *fair*, it's been *a while for you* hasn't it?"

"Yeah... But I was busy, I can't wait to tell her how big I have become, what I accomplished."

"Must feel good..."

*Silence followed*

"Thank you, Auto."

"Thank you too, *for being there at my lowest*."
