What defines the "Bastioner"? It is a question that runs through my mind for hours, yet I cannot find a view. It is illogical, we are created only to serve as mere puppets in a war that never ends. We have no leader, no god, we are commanded only by a blind vengeance.
Romeo, an Angel amongst the seven godly children, was a representative of the "Bastioner". He was not a cyborg, not an alien, but an angel identical to a "Human". He never told me his origins, ever, and only my assumptions could fly in the abyss of my broken mind.
There is a certain point of evolution, it cannot go for eternity.
Ferdinand, I brought you here to end the curse of this world. We will destroy the Bastion race once and for all.
I cannot think straight.
He is frightened by the sight, so am I.
Ferdinand, we must conduct an operation. I speak, he nods as usual. 
My heartbeat grows stronger and faster the more I stare at the corpse. I place my hands on my heaving chest, I think more. A pair of wings surround me, and I fly closer to his corpse. 
I levitate before his faceless head, I caress his cheek as if it was there. I would shed a tear if I could.
They stripped him of all features, and he has become a breathing nothing for harvest.

*Sometime around three-thousand years ago...*

One day I was woken up with a lifelong duty to decipher the Angel classified as "Romeo". I was born after the revolution and his arrival, he was already transferred to a Bastioners' body. He was floating in a stasis chamber, his eye closed, after my arrival I'd spend long times looking at him. My job was to monitor the Angel, I have no idea from where I had gathered the skill to control computers, but I did. Sleepless, working constantly, injecting and dejecting the body. One fateful hour when no one was around, the cameras were off to charge, the Angel woke up and looked at me. He moved, observing his surroundings, his new body, he was not very satisfied. He told me to come closer without talking, I laid off my work and approached the glass chamber with curiosity like a moth to a lamp. He told me to place my palm on his hand through the glass, and I did, and a minute later I found myself in a place no one would believe.

"It feels good to be free." Romeo spoke, breathing in fresh air.

I looked around, the sky was white, the grass was white, flowers bloomed across the plains bringing life and color to the unknown spiritual place. I looked at my hands, they were human. "Where am I." I gasped.

"You are at my favorite corner of existence." He smiled, turning around revealing his beautiful human body to me. "I am Romeo, the Angel of Intuition. You are?"

"I am designated as 'AUTO' 4th." I replied.

"That does not sound right. You seem to lack basic human emotion, ironic considering your current appearance." This reply always confused me at first, I was getting into subjects I could not fathom myself.

"I'll call you **??0000??**, how about that?" He broke the silence with this suggestion, my eyes have widened, I replied with a simple yes.

"Why was I brought here." I asked.

"I want to know more about the current state of our race, I cannot figure on my own what is going on. I feel something is terribly wrong." We walked together across the plains that never seemed to end. I stared at him with more curiosity, my behavior was robotic and lifeless. I began thinking out of the box as he continued speaking, and I managed to spurt out a question that would change me.

"Can you teach me how to feel?"

That question made him shocked, but he smiled shortly after. "Yes, absolutely." He responded and held my hands.

Ferdinand came rushing in on nearby catwalks, yelling questions being confused as usual. He didn't know I hold such power. To be fair, I could've told him a long time ago, but he told me to keep it a secret for as long as I can.

Ferdinand stopped asking so many question, and soon resorted to just a simple sentence. "Just tell me what I need to do."

I felt bad for him, and I began to finally explain the whole situation in depth. 
I am in no way related to Romeo, nor I am a natural Angel. I was a special Bastioner designed to study him, but things have ended up going deeper than they should've. Both of us learned more of the Bastion itself, and made it our mission to stop the insanity the race has gone to. They wanted to weaponize Romeo, and we would not let it. Things have gone terribly wrong, and he had to resort into turning into a *Supreme Angel*. A regular Angel may fabricate so much of it's blood that it ends up ascending further. We are *False Angels*, we are not born naturally as Angels, but we weld their power.
We, together, must erase his body from existence. Rila would've been perfect for this, as she is...

I silence myself. I cannot tell that to him, not yet.

"Yeees?" He asked, his curiosity obviously spiking.

...highly experienced at stuff like this.
We must overcharge light matter to create the matter no Angel can fabricate, dark matter. An element exclusive only to Demons. I have a small sample that we can use as a blueprint. To commence the overcharge we must direct all the light matter that is being produced to one of us.

"I'll take it, easy." Ferdinand quickly responded to the plan, even though I had a whole idea already prepared for me, I suppose he hopefully won't die.

*Sometime around three-thousand years ago again...*

I was at work, as usual, some more years have passed, nothing special.
Romeo would wake up during downtimes, and I'd place my palm on his hand through the glass every time. Each time I learnt more about the world around me, and Romeo began to understand the deal. He would often take me to the most beautiful places across each galaxy, we would visit dense cities together, he would let me taste the exotic foods, with each special hour a day I began to learn more about feelings, it was truly wonderful. The Angels are truly marvelous, he told me a lot about how worlds were created billions of years ago. Apparently before any life existed there were only Angels and Demons, the Angels were born to create, sculpt, build the planets and worlds we know, while the Demons served for destruction, to erase and undo any and all mistakes while also bringing in the balance of sin, to make things more human.
However, one particular event became important in one of our talks.

"We should have never introduced ourselves." His voice was grim, full of sorrow and regret.

I asked what was going on, he told me all about his experience of exploring the Bastion. He figured a lot of history, he was considered a maximum level threat, he was not supposed to be free. He told me about how their own introduction caused an endless arms race, constant brutal wars, how religion began affecting everyone's lives and only those rich in power would prosper, this isn't what they wanted. He told me they had to introduce themselves because every timeline they created ended the same, humanity killed itself over and over and they had to remake the world again and again. He was full of sadness, grief, he sat with his head on his arms crossed. His trust for me dwindled for a short while, but eventually he knew I was nothing like them.

"It cannot continue like this." He continued speaking, "If a child from one of the timelines gain Angelic power and kills another Angel, God will come and not be merciful."

He was very upset, if that worst scenario happened all life as we know would no longer exist. The Angel's project would never happen ever again and only they would remain. He gathered his breath and asked me.

"Will you help me remake this doomed world?"

I comforted him, and told him I would. We will fix this world.

I detached some of the giant tubes that were attached to his organs. "Are you sure you want to be the core of the overcharge?" I asked. He swiftly responded with a yes! So I immediately attached one of the tubes to his gauntlet to see if he would endure one third of the overcharge.
As expected, no! I turned the valve and he immediately glowed white like a lightbulb. He shook not understanding what just happened in those two seconds. Digging through Romeo's organs made me feel very uneasy, mostly sad however. I detached all the endings and had them prepared, I stared at them for a solid second. I connected all the ending wires to my body, and I'd be receiving the matter from both Ferdinand's gauntlet and Romeo's dead core.

"Anytime, I'm ready." Ferdinand affirmed.

I braced myself for excruciating pain. "We will begin generating matter once you touch the dead core, use your gauntlet for that."

Ferdinand reached his golden arm towards the core, but before the touch, he asked something that hit me close to home.

"Will you be alright?"

I clasped the wires with might, my breath running short as I was bracing myself. "Yes, I will."

And with a single slight touch, I was blinded and overstimulated, BUT MY BODY WAS BUILT FOR ANGELIC LIMITS.

*Sometime three-thousand years ago, final.*

How were we human? It is because only our souls were free, Romeo gave me a body I did not recognize, but he claimed that mine and his forms were how Ancient Bastioners looked. What went so wrong with the race? The answer was angelic technology and innovation.
Our bodies were limp at the Bastion as our souls explored the timelines together, it was a dream, but it had to come to an end. We had to stop the madness that was growing beneath and never let them decipher the secrets.

Unfortunately, my own body betrayed both of us.
The shell, the modern Bastioners body had "memories". I call them intermissions. The shell records my whole life even through my soul.

The final day before the special hour, I was alone with Romeo who slept in the chamber as usual.
The chamber slammed shut with emergency doors and alarms blaring and I was completely disrupted. The doors were sealed with the toughest material and I found myself trapped in the room. A green cut sliced through one of the walls and an explosion soon followed. I could not see through the smoke, I was scared, and in a flash Bastioners raised their weapons and shot me to death, multiple times, crushing my head and core. 

My life was over.

But I was suddenly woken up again.

Romeo stood before my broken body, he was in the Bastioners body. He looked down at me, one of his hands beneath my head, he tried his best to smile in the form. His eye didn't express any worry, but I glanced at his chest and it was torn.

"My heart is now yours." 

He joyfully buzzed. I could feel my body healing rapidly as I was in a blank state of consciousness. I looked over at the chamber and it looked like he broke free easily to save me. He grabbed my hands and stood me up, the room was clear but it was obvious they would come back soon. Alarms blared but he told me not to worry.

I gained my sense and he suddenly hugged me very tightly. He closed his eye, "I believe you'll make an amazing angel." He said. 

I hugged him back, saddened by the fact of what's coming. We began to rush towards the surface, running together through the hallways, he swiftly taught me the basics as we smashed through the gates. But it was quickly over as one of the walkers blocked our way, we knew there would be many more to come.

"Grab my chest, transfer as much light matter as you can." He said, "Let me ascend."

I was confused at first, we quickly hid in a blind spot of the underground. "Do as I say, trust me. You told me that these bodies are capable of that power, right?" 
It hit me, I understood. I held my palm against his empty chest and focused on my palm. "After this, focus on the plains we used to often visit. My heart should let you enter that place smoothly."

"What do you mean by that?" I ask with worry.

"You can't stay here, you must stay hidden until the right time occurs." He replied, the inevitable thought of us separating shook me. He grasped my hand that was on his chest and told me, "But you wouldn't go away right now, would you?" I looked down in response.

"It's equally hard for me too." He began to softly speak, "I share the same feelings towards you, but we must separate." He put away my hand from his chest, glowing symbols started appearing behind his back.

"Remake the world for me."

And before I knew it, I found myself at the plains. I dropped down on the white grass, unable to express my emotion in the cursed body.
Hundreds of years would pass, I was stranded among the strings of the timelines. I visited many places, but it felt empty without him.
During the last hundred years, I found the Holy Earth. I lived there as a mole observing the surroundings until I heard of the fourth Ferdinand.

My body continued to shine, my hands were open trying to fabricate the matter as I suffered through the extreme heat. The ceiling cracked, the meltdown penetrated its way down to the lowest level. The whole underground strongly shook and muffled screams were heard from afar. Ferdinand could sense more of those Angel Bastioners coming up, he tried to urge me to hurry, but his sound fell to deaf ears. I was stuck deep in my mind, the pain leaving me completely numb. I was afraid, deciphering such a complex element was not easy in such little time. 

But,
For some reason.
I remembered my first fabrication, the small steel cube. I have kept it with me at all times, a precious memory. I merged it with the sample I had and the dark matter grew just big enough for me to gather remaining data. I swiftly decode the last chunks and manage to fabricate the matter I should not be able to master. I try my best to yell at Ferdinand, telling him to cut the wires so I can unleash the quadrillion cells of light matter coursing through my veins. I position my palms facing the front so I can prepare to unleash the energy in a massive beam.
He understood, he cut the wire, and all the light around was absorbed by the beam. There was no sound, the only light source became the beam itself. It erased all that it touched, the walls disappeared, the Bastioners disappeared, everything around us disappeared. I erased Romeo's dead remains last, and the beam ran out, followed by a deafening delayed boom. I slowly closed my eyes as if I was falling asleep.

But I blinked, and I found myself at the plains with Ferdinand. I found myself in my wished human body, and I looked at the horizon. A figure stood there turned on his back, staring at the fields. I swiftly dashed through the grass trying to reach him, I ran an exhaustingly long mile, I ran more, he was so close to me, I wanted to tell him all that happened. I did not care for the dizziness that just occurred, I ran and tears flew from my face. 
But my feet were suddenly roped with black chains, and I was dragged on the floor, away from him. Ferdinand was also chained, and the chains broke through the fabric of existence. We fell through countless dimensions, and with a hard impact we landed at the Holy Earth's core. I refused to get up, I was back in my cursed body. I hit the ground with my fist in rage and I screamed. My eyes were crying but no tears were coming out, I felt a fuzzy arm envelop my head and felt Ferdinand's tight hug squeeze me.

I slowly felt more comfort, we have just saved all of existence after all.
