Auto walked through the empty hallways of the Core during downtimes. He looked through files, data, anything to find anything relevant but nothing was out there. Figuring that the documents may be hidden in lower, more restricted areas, he took an elevator to deeper levels of the Core and tried opening the first door he came across. REJECTED, his permissions were taken away already. He continued to scan his card, the lock kept on making a loud beeping noise with red text reading "INVALID". He stopped, and stared at the gate, thinking of what to do next.

"You need help with anything?" A voice echoed throughout the dark hallway, Auto swiftly looked over and saw an unknown figure.

"*Who are you?* *What are you doing here?!*" He yelled out, pointing fingers with question and confusion.

"Hmmm." The figure thought out loud, "Just walking around here, nothin' much."

It walked closer to Auto, revealing itself under light. It was a short, blue bunny boy, with long deep blue messy hair that curled down like waterfalls, wearing the most casual clothes in a serious place like this.

"Hol' on lemme get this for you." He walked closer and scanned the lock with his own identification card, unlocking the gate in front of them both. "The name's Gabriel, you are?" He munched on a honey cookie that seemingly came out of nowhere.

Auto stared at him, confused, he wasn't used to such casual and improper talks inside of the Core. "I am *Auto*. Who could you possibly *actually* be?" Narrowing his eye towards him.

"I'm new around here, are you so uneased by my clothing? So sorry, I forgot my uniform and such back home." He continued munching on the cookie.

"Not *uneased*, it is a *surprise.*" Auto thought for a little while, "You *should not forget* your necessities, you should know by now how *strict* the *rules* are here. It is a *surprise* you even got so far into *the Core* dressed like *that*."

"So judgmentaaaaal." Gabriel scoffed, finishing his cookie, "Well I'm off. It was nice meeting you, take a cookie, bye."

Gabriel just walked away into the darkness without waiting for a response from Auto, he looked at the cookie he was given and scraped it off of his mouth, trying his best to eat it.

Years passed since Emilia's first arrival on the divine lands of Holy Earth. She sat on a pillow and played games on the television, more notably a sequel to vib-ribbon named "vib-ripple". The newer game was so much more colorful in contrast with the simple black and white its predecessor had. The bunny character made of vibrating lines jumped on pictures as if it were a trampoline, collecting various objects. Emilia snacked on spicy chips and drank water as she was completely zoomed in on the game, eager to earn an unbeatable high-score in all the levels. Her and Akimi's days usually consisted of going to school, learning, reciting the Holy Earth's anthem so they know it by heart, and gaming. One day however, both of them were surprised by a gift from the higher ranks. The second Director, Kugi, opened the door to their room holding a box with small holes at its sides. He gently placed the box on the floor, and opened it once Emilia and Akimi were gathered in front of it. Inside it was a regular black and white Maine Coon cat, "Ronin is his name, take good care and study his behavior." The second Director spoke, Emilia was completely enthralled by the cat, she immediately picked him up and stared him in the eyes. "Mraaauuuu" He meowed, clearly wanting to go down.
Emilia and Akimi continued to grow with the cat. More years would pass by, they blissfully graduated, they attended more classes, they grew closer to one another. They sang together, they played games together, they studied together, they aged until they were eighteen when things began to escalate. They were introduced to two people of the Maine Coon cat species, Laura and Stanford, though they were assigned a different room, they still managed to get a bunch of talks in. After graduating from study they were assigned jobs, they were tasked with general maintenance at the Core, having to fix any and all problems that occurred all the time within the deep underground maze.

Though, years later, things escalated further.

Emilia was just relaxing in her bed with Akimi after a long day of working. It was a sunny day outside, the winds howled as usual, but without a warning their phones rang out with urgency. There was an order, and they had to attend within an hour. Such notification caught Emilia off-guard, she quickly woke up Akimi and handed him his phone. They swiftly dressed up and strutted down the hallways into the grand entrance of the Core, where the floor was paved of reflective marble and golden trims. They also bumped into Laura and Stanford, unusually.

"Perfect, perfect." The first Director, Xavier, muttered as the four of them lined up in front of him as he was surrounded by knights. "I have not seen you in a long time, Emilia and Akimi. I only wish the best for the both of you."

"Father, if I may ask, what exactly were we called for here?" Emilia raised her hand and asked.

He flaunted his cape and gave a mean look at her, "From this day, you will put the CORE before your life. You will become a necessary step in progression to ascension. A message from heavens has been sent, and we must oblige."

The group looked at each other with confusion, they didn't seem to catch on what he was saying.

"You will be given the title of a 'Hero', all four of you will embark on orders we force. You will protect our Angels at any cost, at any time. You will be given time to train, to study, to prepare. Failure will only bring another calamity upon everything that exists. You are to be assigned a schedule tomorrow, you are free of your current employment. Heavens and humanities wishes will come true, for the Holy Earth, for everything that ever exists." And with that, he got his knights to surround him and safely escort him away.

It was clear, they were being drafted to war. The group stood frozen except for Stanford, who quickly spouted "What do you mean that's your father?"

During the afternoon they all returned to their rooms. Emilia closed the doors after entering before Akimi. She covered her face with her hands and exhaled, she sat on her bed and grew a little frustrated.

"You know what that means, right?" She softly spoke to Akimi, who sat right next to her.

"I'm aware." He replied, "But I don't think it'll be too bad."

"Really?!" She was shocked by that answer, "We've been here our entire lives, you should know that it's practically a death sentence! You never see the same 'Heroes' around here, do you? It's always different people!"

Akimi was slightly pushed back by *her* answer, his ears turned to the back, "Chill, chill. I was only trying to be optimistic." He gestured with his hands.

"I know, I'm sorry." She muttered. He wrapped his arms around her, and so did she. 

Knocks were heard at their door to surprise, Akimi went to open the doors...

"SURPRISE!" Laura yelled out as she barged into their room with Stanford. "WHOOAAT!!! You guys have two beds?!"

"Waitwaitwait what's going on here?" Emilia exclaimed.

"We came to visit? Why not! We'll have to bond well as a team so let's start here!" She weirdly spoke, probably downed a couple of beers.

"That second bed does not get used at all if you guys want it it's free." Akimi spoke, laid-back.

"Sure! We'll take it!" Laura placed her hands to her waist, "STANFORD! Be so kind and take the bed to our room!" She raised a hand and signaled with her finger.

He gulped, "Yes ma'am..."

"Why are you suddenly taking our bed?" Emilia was confused.

"We have just one SMALL bed. At first I thought it was for a stupid reason like cost and expense but no it seems like they want us to smooch and kiss like there's no end." She groaned.

"You guys aren't already a thing?" Emilia was shocked by the response, the scraping noise of Stanford dragging the bed on the floor was strong.

"No?!" She exclaimed, "Yes we do look the same, but that doesn't mean anything! We're two strangers who live different lives manidkwuttheHolyEarthexpectshereseriously."

"Huh." Both Akimi and Emilia thought.

"Damn aKIMI you look kinda fire over there." She pointed at him, making a smooching noise with her mouth.

Akimi recoiled back with his hand on his chest, unable to say anything due to his awkward unsocial nature. Laura was however swiftly cut by Emilia's yell, but she was also quickly silenced by Laura hushing her and giving the both of them a bottle of wine, "Let's not get too crazy over here."

"What? Thanks, I guess?" She held the bottle in her hands.

Stanford finally came back, slightly exhausted from dragging a bed across a whole floor of the Core.

"Oh, I just remembered, so sorry! We're not allowed to be in each others room right? We'll head back, enjoy that wine though! Wasn't cheap!" Laura continued with her nonsense.

"What? But I just got here?" Stanford gestured with his hands in defeat.

The doors closed after they walked away, Emilia and Akimi looked at each other and just shrugged it off. The next days would slowly march forward, they'd talk to each other more, they'd attend military classes together sharing mean stares, they'd always try to up one another during training. It was a mess, but their first day was still far, for now.
