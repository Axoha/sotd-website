It has been long, every second of my life feels like an inconsistent water droplet hitting me. I stay in my room, haunted by the knowledge, I was betrayed, everyone I loved is gone, I was used, I am a machine that is only tossed over from one to next. I need to do something, I need to die, I need to fulfill the dreams of my brother.

*THE SEVENTH MUST DIE,*
*THE SEVENTH MUST DIE,*
*THE SEVENTH MUST-*

Before Auto broke completely, he felt the touch of someone familiar on his head. He felt relief, a burden that was swiftly pushed off his mind.

"Don't." Ferd spoke behind him as he calmed Auto, "You are not alone."

There was silence in the dark room, lit up only by a single blue screen from his personal computer. Auto looked back at him, unable to express the anguish he feels.

"We came up with a plan to stop this all, will you please help us?" Ferd asked.

"I am not sure, I will try." Auto looked down, "Nothing remains."

Ferd took a moment to observe the room, it was similar to theirs. The walls were plastered with notes and papers, as if Auto was plotting a plan just like them. He couldn't tame his curiosity, and so he asked. "What are all the notes here for?"

"Total annihilation." Auto spoke, "The reconstruction must happen."

Ferd was horrified by that response, Auto looked possessed saying such things. The notes began to make more sense, he has not resigned from the Holy Earth, he has been working on the next big step in their ranks.

"I will not let you do that." Ferd shook his head.

"Why?" Auto begged, "Why do you always insist on continuing the madness?"

"I am not. I want to fix this world, innocent people deserve to live." Ferd stood his ground, "I ask of you, please, give our plan a chance."

He reached his hand out to Auto, who with trembling hands and hesitation agreed. "But what if it fails?"

"It will not." He assured, "This cannot fail."

After shaking their hands they stood silently, Auto looked down at him due to his sheer size. 

"But what if-" 

His next speech was abruptly interrupted by Ferd hugging him, squeezing his waist.

He looked up at Auto's dull expression, "Everyone deserves better."

The silence, interrupted by a sudden call. Auto was being called upon a parade, unusual, there were no plans. Auto broke from Ferd's grasp and rushed to his computer to set a screen for the broadcast. The Spears marched through the main wide street, the news headline read that a new pointless 'Supreme Order' has been put into place, ultimately replacing the Holy Earth. The death of the six Directors were not mourned, but celebrated. The Seventh walked at the middle of the convoy, his giant figure out for the public to see, speaking of an ideology to wash peoples minds with. It was obvious, they had to start their plans right now.
Auto and Ferd, with their ability to vanish and appear at any place they desired, worked together to gather the necessary requirements for the plan to work. They found a secluded place in the ruins of an older city, where Emilia, Auto, and Ferd would all eventually meet. Auto, upon arrival, looked with disgust at Emilia, who shared the same look back at him. Ferd was nowhere to be seen, but after being late by a solid minute he walked towards them, holding a person by his hand guiding them to the place.

"Who is that?" Auto pointed his lanky finger towards the person, resting the other hand on his hip.

Ferd looked back at the person with his big eyes, that person was strikingly similar to Ferdinand. He murmured, telling her to introduce herself.

"I'm Fernanda." She awkwardly spoke, "I'm a retired soldier, I come from an era that-"

"Do not tell me you are reinitiating *Operation Seven-Twenty* all over again?!" Auto exclaimed with a fierce emotion, "I thought this part of *his old script* would never resurface ever?!"

"The gauntlets you build a long time ago." Ferd calmly spoke back, "Do you have any ideas for a better fit?"

"I suppose not." Auto scoffed and crossed his arms.

"Fernanda." Ferd looked back at her, "You remember what you're here for, right?"

"Yes I do." She replied, "Just tell me what I need to do."

"Ferd how did you find her? What did you even say to convince her to come here?" Emilia stood up and talked, her curiosity limitless.

"We have no special machines or anything to identify a perfect fit like the Holy Earth had." He went on a speech, "So I scoured the cosmos for a Ferdinand who has already lost it all, someone who had nothing left to sacrifice anymore. I talked with so many, so far only Fernanda here willingly accepted my request."

"You know this little dude just came up to me real slow when I was on a cig break and after he introduced himself and such he finally told me what was up and I was like 'You can't be serious just count me in already!' and he could not be much more happier."

"You talk a lot." Emilia replied.

"I sure do." She scoffed.

"Pick any of the gauntlets you see on the table." Ferd tugged her jacket, "This is the most important part."

Fernanda look at him. She walked towards the table and eyed over the eight shining golden gauntlets that rested upon each other. Thinking for a bit, she chose the slim and long arm. Emilia readied her notebook and pen to jot down any important notes. With a smirk Fernanda fit her left arm into the gauntlet. The room grew silent.

"Is anything supposed to happen?" She spoke as the three around her only stared.

"Uh." Emilia awkwardly replied, "Good thing the worst hasn't happened-"

"Raise your hand into the sky, imagine any object you want to grab." Auto sighed, "I assume you already know what that does."

"*She does.*" Ferd whispered to Auto.

With a blazingly fast move, she raised her whole arm to the ceiling and closed her eyes, imagining something. A few seconds have passed and nothing happened. Ferd sat down on the concrete floor as he looked at her struggle.

"This is so stupid." She was disappointed, looking at her gauntlet. "I could really go for a-"

A hot dog materialized into the palm of the gauntlet. 

"*Really? Again?*" Auto was unamused, while the others were glad that the gauntlet actually works. 

"Oh my god." Fernanda stared at the delicious hot dog, slightly drooling. "This thing actually works."

As she picked it up and went in for a bite, Auto loudly buzzed at her to not eat it. He yanked it from her hands and placed it on the table, finding a knife to slice the hot dog in half. 

"Hey!" Fernanda wasn't happy, "Give it back!"

"I would not like to see you choking on dust here." Auto exclaimed back to her, slicing the hot dog in half.

The contents of the hot dog were perfectly normal.

"*How?*" Auto was baffled.

"Dude, not cool, I'm not sharing this with anyone." She walked back to the table and took the hot dog, biting into it and eating it.

"Your body has not adapted to the gauntlet, nor you should know the exact formula of a hot dog!" Auto yelled at her, confused and bewildered.

"Dude." Fernanda stared back at him, "I just love hot dogs, man."

She finished up the hot dog, licked her fingers, "Tell me what's next." she turned around to the three and spoke.

"Uh..." Emilia couldn't come up with a thing to say, "We'll get you on some proper training by Auto..?"

"Yes, that is exactly what is supposed to follow." Ferd told Emilia with a little side-eye.

Auto stood there, frozen in a trance as the conversations kept on going. He heard a familiar voice coming from his right, a light shined brightly. He couldn't see who was calling, but he knew, he felt his body move without control, reaching out to the sky.
But Ferd held his hand.

"What are you doing?" He asked.

Auto did not reply with anything, he snapped back to reality with an embarrassed dull look.

"Show her how to use the gauntlet, she's eager to find out what it does!" He tried to cheer him a bit, and Auto swiftly let go of his troubles to continue with the plan.

That was one out of the seven Ferdinand's already allied. Time began to flow fast, day by day they looked for more Ferdinands' as the first one, Fernanda, trained hard, understanding the logic of creation. It wasn't long before she joined in the family, acting like a long time member despite meeting with them a week ago. They heard their doorbell ring, and upon opening it arrived a surprise.

"Let's get those interviews started, who could you be?"

"They call me Bernerd, I'm something of a chill guy. Figured instead of drugging myself I could go on a REAL trip y'know? Y'all have some of the goods right? I'm running short on cash, I'll DIE without that stuff." His eyes were concerningly red.

"Uh huh, got that." Emilia spouted as she slowly looked towards Ferd with a weird stare, wondering whatever could've happened to this dude.

A few days have passed once more.

"I'm the King Merdiarie. Upon meeting the angel I knew I had to come commit to the right act." He was fat, similar to how Ferdinand used to look like before the first day.

"*THE King Merdiare???*" Emilia was bewildered, "Weren't you massive?! Skyscraper sized?!"

"Unlike my beautiful ex-wife Queena, I can control my size." He laughed it off.

"That makes a lot of sense actually..." She jotted down some notes into the notebook, glancing over at Ferd again who was busy playing with a Merdi. "Who is that?" She couldn't help but ask.

"Oh him?" He pointed at the Merdi, "That's my child, among many others."

Another Merdi popped up from behind his back, staring down Emilia. They were all clones with one big eye and a shadow that obscured half their face. 

Two more weeks would pass by.

"Madam, care for a cup of tea?" A classy Ferdinand appeared with Ferd.

"Uh." Emilia reacted, "Tell me your name, first of all."

"Ferolicious." He closed his eyes as he spoke with pride, "My tea business is running really bad, god help me."

"*This guy makes the best tea..!*" Ferd put a hand next to his mouth and whispered to her.

"Surely a sip won't hurt." She accepted the offer and got herself a mug.

Three days later.

"What the hell." Emilia was frightened by what he brought in this day, "Ferd..?"

It was a mechanical creature barely resembling a Ferdinand. It's face was covered by a shattered screen mount that mimicked facial expressions, its whole body was skinny and torn. It breathed heavily, acting like a wild animal.

"Does this thing even sp-"

"...water... need..." A text to speech-like voice came from a speaker embedded in its body.

"Kind sir! I may assist you right there!" Ferolicious overheard the new arrival, he rushed in and with the gauntlet he raised his hand and manifested a cup of tea.

The creature, in response, screeched and leapt at him but was quickly apprehended almost immediately. Despite the aggressive nature he was quickly understood and accepted into the family. Fernanda, Bernerd, Merdiare, Ferolicious, and Ferdevor; those were the five Ferd chose to ally. There was one more left.

"Akimi." Ferd appeared next to his father at the middle of the night, "You know the whole thing I was talking to you about?"

"You've been travelling through the cosmos recruiting Ferd's? How's that going?" He tilted his head, he's always been curious about his own sons journey, talking about it each night.

"I am finally almost done!" He exclaimed, he held something big behind his back for him to give.

"What's left?" He smirked, he knew that Ferd has something prepared for him.

Ferd finally revealed the thing he was hiding, it was a recovered gauntlet Akimi had used long ago. He immediately recognized it, the design was just iconic.

"You want me to join in, huh?" He was surprised, touching and handling the gauntlet thinking back to the past.

"Yes." Ferd smiled, "You would be perfect!"

"And you're gonna be the seventh Ferdinand?" He looked at his eyes.

"That's right." Ferd nodded, "Put on the gauntlet! I want to see if you still got it!"

"Say less." He smiled, fitting his right hand into the gauntlet like he did ages ago. 

But his body violently rejected the gauntlet, right after equipping it he was paralyzed. He bled from his mouth and nose, Ferd immediately reacted and took off the gauntlet off of him. He was left shook, dropping onto the ground. His breathing was heavy and ragged.

"Father, are you okay?!" He was terribly worried, glancing over at the gauntlet and to his body.

Akimi struggled to muster up the strength to speak, but with his will he grabbed Ferd's hands. "Yes I am, son. Don't worry."

"I don't understand why this is happening..." He was in disbelief as he held his hands, nothing like this was supposed to happen, it was nonsense!

"You'll have to find another, or take the gauntlet and fill the role for me." He groaned, "I'm so sorry to disappoint you like this."

The rest of the night was spent with an unfortunate conversation and disappointment. His injuries were surprisingly severe, rejecting Ferd's healing property, but he would eventually turn out to be fine. As the moon marched throughout the night, Auto snuck back into an unknown area located near the Core. The Spears were busy, hard at work constructing something huge under the new order of the Seventh - but it was actually coming from a blueprint Auto created. It was another collider, scaling up to five times the size of the one that started everything three-thousand years ago. Auto leaned on the metal rails, watching as the sparks flew from the construction. The construction was expected to be done in three days. During that time at the other side the variations of Ferdinand trained hard, learning different techniques they could use to utilize creation in combat. During their breaks they'd waste time playing videogames together, having a bunch of computers in one room to play old games on a shared network. Emilia was usually in charge of scouting, sitting on a custom-built tower watching if there are any potential threats. She picked up a hobby to quell the boredom, writing. Her notebook was filled with everything that only she could quickly navigate, from research to stories, the Ferdinands would often huddle around her each evening to listen to her new tales. Each Ferdinand was at their lowest before they were picked up by Ferd himself, and their lives couldn't have gone any better since. They'd become a newfound family.
The gauntlets allowed each of them to morph existence to whatever they pleased. Compared to the golden arm Ferdinand wielded, the gauntlets seemed much more compatible and easier to use. Emilia researched them closely with Auto, coming up with a theory that the golden arm is far more powerful at the cost of being extremely difficult to use. They also wondered about the strange phenomenon that occurred with Akimi, thinking that the gauntlet may have rejected him due to his cursed state. Fernanda was indifferent about the gauntlets, caring more for Ferd rather than combat, she'd be in charge of babysitting despite Ferd claiming he can take care of himself. Bernerd was given his own room, occasionally blasting music and smoking marijuana. When asked for his skill he was surprisingly capable, having a technique to use smoke to obscure himself and fight stealthily. Merdiare was already experienced, usually taking care of his kids rather than practicing with the gauntlet. Ferolicious was a classy Englishman, coming from an era before the first wars. He spent his time observing futuristic technology while brewing some great tea for the crew to drink, which the gauntlet made far easier to do. Most of his fabrications, funnily enough, looked aged - straight up from the nineteenth century. The last allied Ferdinand was Ferdevor, there isn't much to say of him. His technique is just being violent, and many are afraid of speaking to him as he has very drastic emotional outbursts. Despite the chaos, they all bonded well, taking pictures together making memories. Ferd stayed in touch with Akimi, he did not need the gauntlet as he already was an Angel. Akimi kept it, tinkering with it each night to see if something can work. Day by day, Ferd felt more sad that his own father could not spend time with the new crew.
On the morning when the construction of the collider was finally complete, the crew turned on their television to watch the latest news. Everyone was huddled, curious as to what a collider was even doing in this day. Auto was in his basement room, meditating. It was a method he practiced each day to not lose his mind. There was chatter in the main room, Emilia was not familiar with this new image of the 'Supreme Order' with its distinct black and white style. There would be a collider exhibition today, broadcasted live on camera, no one knew what the purpose for it was.
But their watch party would be cut short.
A machine gun was heard revving up from the other side, which upon firing shred their whole wall. They all took cover and Bernerd swiftly obscured the whole room in smoke.

"**UPON VIOLATION OF MULTIPLE LAWS PER THE SUPREME ORDER, YOU MUST TURN YOURSELF IN FOR THE GREATER GOOD.**" A speaker from a Spear sounded loudly. The crew ran fast inside their building, Ferd yelling to grant each of themselves a pair of wings. Emilia took a moment to look out a shattered window, a horde of Spears - including the smaller variants were seen closing in on the building. Ferd grew himself a pair of small wings and leapt out of a balcony, and soon the rest proceeded to do the same. Emilia had to stay grounded, but mobility wasn't an issue as she could easily keep up with her cursed abilities. Capital ships of the Supreme Order warped into the sky, initiating an orbital fire almost immediately with its devastating beam strikes. The Spears, equipped with jetpacks were very capable of catching up, sliding on the walls of buildings and firing simultaneously. Ferd fabricated a piece of small headwear for everyone that allowed the crew to communicate.

"FERD, lead us to the populated center of the city! The Holy Earth by law cannot destroy their people!" Emilia yelled out to the intercom as she crawled on the buildings, taking out any Spears that she could. 

The intercom was filled with chaos, everyone yelling at each other giving callouts. They were experienced however, even the unfair nature of the Spears' homing bullets could not graze one member of the crew. Bernerd's smoke helped tremendously, he found great joy in evading the Spears and tearing them apart with the heavy gauntlet like everyone else. The beam strikes from the capital ships shook the earth, leaving debris everywhere they looked.
Auto was still in his room, he could not hear, but sense. He was busy reaching out to the depths of his soul, but upon a sudden interruption by a Spear he was forced to wake up. In an instant he pierced the machine with his long arm, tearing it apart. There was a human pilot inside, but that was not to his worry, everyone was gone. Instant anxiety flourished in his mind, the crew of false angels would not last when Ferdinand appears. That was when he began to hear the familiar voice, he looked back to the collider.
The crew managed to reach the populated corners of the city, but the relentless strikes from the capital ships did not stop. Emilia was dumbfounded, the Supreme Order just did not care anymore. Their locations and live recordings were broadcasted on every screen they flew by. Ferd did not fight against the Spears, instead he protected each member from a fatal mistake that could've occurred. The exosuits had nothing on them, but that was all gonna change when a bright flash emitted in the sky. The Spears backed away, the capital ships stopped firing, and the Angel of War descended from the skies. The sight of the titan left only hopelessness in their hearts, they could only run. Ferdinand vanished and appeared right behind them, Ferd swiftly used his power in a reflex to teleport everyone away. He noticed, despite the crew not being too far off, he figured that he'd need to get rid of Ferd first before even being able to strike down the rest. He vanished and appeared fast around him, throwing deadly mean strikes that barely grazed Ferd himself. The evasion was cut short by Ferdinand learning his tricks, he grabbed his face and pummeled him right onto the asphalt ground. Ferd was very durable despite his look, he managed to get a hang of himself and vanished right away.
Auto appeared at the collider's control room, the voice continued to guide his soul. He initiated an eventual fire sequence. The collider was a weapon meant to channel the energy of the trapped sacred angels, such power being able to erase anything that ever existed on its end, similar to the dark matter he fabricated when he destroyed the Bastion. But it was none of that, it was a collider meant to end everything. The sequence begun, and it with the hymn of machinations going underneath and the power of pure energy being channeled sound through the space.
Ferdinand sensed something was not right. He instantly vanished, leaving the crew alone. He appeared at the colliders ring, standing in front of Auto who seemed to look completely possessed. He had only one thing to say.

"Romeo..."

Ferdinands eyes widened upon hearing that name. Auto forced his mouth to open with the strength of his two hands, and from his open mouth climbed a human. The robotic alien body of Auto fell on the ground once his desired form broke free. The collider glowed, and the remnant of Auto turned back to Ferdinand, smiling. He fell into the pit of the collider where all the power was being stored, and within seconds a massive beam continuously shot into the sky. It was terribly loud, the six sacred angels that were harvested broke free. They flew in circles around the beam before disappearing, and once the beam itself was gone, everything stopped for one second. Ferdinand braced himself before all the pent up tension released, but what appeared before him was a giant supreme angel with a human body. The kids that were in choir in churches that day sang, oblivious to the events that were unfolding. Civilians watched in horror, the world was silent. The supreme angel looked around, raising both of its arms into the sky. Ferdinand channeled his energy and tried to pierce through the angel with a punch, but it simply did not work. It was a while since he felt this way, weak. The supreme Angel of Intuition, Auto, covered both of his arms with weaponry, the engines of war itself. That second, everything except for angels would be demolished within the two-hundred kilometer area. The skies went dark. The supreme angel aimed and fired, the rays of light destroying everything turning all the effort to dust. The affected area grew, buildings flew as they were cut in half, sinners and people were precisely shot into the head, the shockwaves of destruction unquenchable. The angel fired into direction, capital cities were shredded within seconds all around earth.

Until the Seventh stepped up on a mountain.

The supreme angel was quick to act, stopping all fire. The silence was deafening as the smoke from the scorched lands emanated. The angel aimed and fired everything it had, fabricating even more weaponry to destroy the Seventh. He, in return, channeled the power of past six Directors. Their curses, their destruction, their sin, all of it merged with the Seventh's ability would grant a wish.

"*You are simply foolish.*" The Seventh spoke as the rays of light approached, he had all of the Directors' hearts in chains, "*Thank you, perfect. Simply marvelous.*"

A massive rift besides the supreme angel opened, and from it came a glowing trident that pierced directly through its heart, neutralizing the threat. All the bullets rained down upon the Seventh, which terminated his body, the impact simply overkill. Silence only followed, the gods of this land dead.

// // // //

Ferd fell to his knees, the angel's impact leaving him to tears. The crew and Emilia were alive, almost unscathed, but the people, the amount of innocence slaughtered that day would leave him crying.

"I TOLD AUTO TO NEVER DO THAT!!!" The crystal clear tears fell onto the ground as he sobbed, "I TOLD HIM TO NOT DO IT..."

Emilia was right besides him, they had a wide view on the ruins. Ferd threw himself into her arms and continued to sob, she brushed his fur with her hands and silently comforted him. The corpse of the dead angel loomed over the lands in the dead gray skies of the burnt earth.
