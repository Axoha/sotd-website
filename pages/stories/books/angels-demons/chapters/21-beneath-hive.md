Both of them ran through the dark grimy hallways, the Bastioner Angel's destruction echoed and muffled throughout the walls, it's screams were never-ending. They ran corridor after corridor, until they opened the steel gates to wide, open factory. It is as if the entire underground was dug up, there were no walls in sight, the space was tangled with conveyor belts and catwalks. Pistons clanked and shut, automated machines worked to no end to create an empty Bastioner.

"We must go deeper, this is still not it." Auto spoke, as he took in a second to stare at the creation.

Ferdinand took a deeper look at the conveyor belts, each belt carried its own parts that would later merge together and form a Bastioner without it's eyes. He thought, he looked at Auto, then looked back. The light has suddenly penetrated through the ceiling, there wasn't any time to react, it had already thrown it's trident at them both tearing the supports that were holding up the catwalk. Both of them fell on different belts, sliding right into different fabricators. The angel screamed, deciding to dive and confront Auto first. The Bastioner landed on its feet and crushed the belt beneath, Auto struggled to stand back on his feet. The Angel tried to speak, but all that came out was noise. It fabricated another long trident in its hands eager to destroy Auto, but he ran and leapt onto different belts. Ferdinand was moving along a belt with parts at the front and back, the pistons crushed the pieces together in a synchronized manner without an escape. Suddenly, Auto came up with a plan, he jumped and snagged a long wire from the ceiling and awaited for the Angel to throw another trident. He purposefully positioned himself in a direction where the trident would be headed, and once it was thrown, he threw the wire that tied itself onto the trident pulling him directly to the place he needed to be. He was crushed through several walls, rooms, floors, but eventually the trident lost it's force embedded itself into the ground. Unscathed, he was at one of the many main rooms used to control the whole facility beneath the Bastion itself, with a smug flick he opened the emergency control panel and turned every setting to the highest possible value, a meltdown would be imminent. Ferdinand fought with the crushing pistons, managing to hold it in his golden arm with all his strength, but all of a sudden they all froze. He took this as an opportunity to escape and so he leapt onto a catwalk looking around everywhere for Auto. The machinery hissed with steam, the Angel locked it's eyes with Ferdinand and dove right onto him. Ferdinand grabbed it's head with his arm in fear as he was pummeled through the many belts and catwalks. The Angel moved his arm out of his face with it's many hands and bit painfully deeply into his shoulder. Ferdinand managed to get out of its grasp and kicked it far, he held his injury with his other palm, sighing and bleeding. He readied himself for another impact as he noticed the Angel ready to pounce again, but in a turn of events it was impaled with its own glowing trident thrown by Auto. He took the impaled Angel by the trident and threw it into one of the crushing sections, the Angel squirmed and screamed it's noise eventually fading. The facility was getting very hot, the machines moved at extreme speeds and pieces fell anywhere everywhere. 

Auto noticed the huge injury, "Light matter nullifies itself, that'll take a while to heal. Protect your heart." He brought a bunch of wire resembling fabric and began to wrap it around the injury.

"Thanks." Ferdinand gasped, he bled from his noise, covered in sweat.

Both of them ran off to the next area, exhausted. Alarms began blaring and Bastioners from the surface arrived into the facility, too late. The walkers searched with their lights among the belts and the Bastioners eagerly tried to fix the meltdown. Ferdinand and Auto stood on another platform, ready to move even deeper, Auto switched the lever and the platform began descending down.

"I thought there'd be a lot more." Ferdinand muttered, feeling a little better in the cool of the dark shaft.

"Maybe we have come at the *exact* time." Auto replied, "Maybe these False Angels aren't even sided with the Bastion."

"I suppose that would make sense." He sighed, "What's the whole deal with this massive area underground?"

"It's where all Bastioners come from. The husks are fabricated beneath the world, and the minds and organs of other living beings are implemented. It's how I was created, I would give all to know who I was before." He spoke, in a sad, lonely tone.

The knowledge sent shivers down Ferdinand's spine, he looked at the palm of his hands, feeling unease.

Auto noticed the reaction, "I believe execution is the unfortunate only way. No Bastioners knows, unless they are out of the system."

The platform stopped, they were at the absolute bottom. Signs on the wall were undecipherable, only the icon of an Angel was clear. "I dread for what I'm about to see." Auto mumbled to himself. Corpses of semi-mutated Bastioner Angels littered the entrance hallway, seemingly to be rejected by the Angel's matter. It was dark, the lights were out, they walked through the puddles of blood, observing the surroundings.
They have reached the first metal gate, Auto stared at the power generator for a second before punching it, forcing the gate to open. Another metal gate stood behind, and another, the containment chamber heavily fortified. Auto's patience ran short at the last metal gate, he tore the doors with rage, exhaling with desperation. Behind the gate was a dock, a spacious room consumed by the abyss. An unknown shallow liquid sat at the ground, Auto braced himself and walked into the control room to turn on the lights.

He took a deep breath.

The white lights flashed blindingly, Ferdinand covered his eyes from the sudden change until they slowly adapted to the morbid sight. A colossal cross stood at the center of the waters, a humanoid giant with pale skin was crucified upon it, its stomach, chest wide open and veins injected with wires. Faceless, unmoving, it was an Angel kept alive on the lowest conditions to be harvested for its blood. 
Auto froze, staring. He fell onto his knees, holding his hands to his chest. In dread, fear, sadness, he gasped out.

"Brother... Romeo."
