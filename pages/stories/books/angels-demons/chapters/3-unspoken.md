Weeks have passed since the opening ceremony, drinks have been shared, exams have been passed; however Rila was absent throughout most of it, barely getting to share time with Ferdinand. He would live in her apartment in the meantime, sometimes staying over at the core. It became a boring and depressing life cycle of doing the same things despite the excitement of getting to hold scary weapons. He wondered this whole time what they were training for, he thought the Holy Earth was at peace, but there were reports of illegal and traitorous activity happening all around. Many things inspired him yet his journal was missing. Back at the apartment, he laid down on the very comfy queen sized bed that took most of the room. Only wind and a clock ticking could be heard; everyday was quiet, until the next morning.

A door opens.

"*Gooooooooood mooooorning big boooooy* we have a *biiiiiiiig* day ahead of ourselves!" A feminine voice sounds across the room, "You've been *REAAALLY* enjoying my bed huh?"

Ferdinand, half awake, stares at the girl. "Whuhs?"

"I FINALLY get a break, I get to DRINK, I get to PARTY, I've been filling PAPERS, PAPERS!" Drowsily yelling, Rila looked devastated yet inside she seemed happy. "I'm *TIIIIIIRED*."

Without leaving space for Ferdinand to think, Rila collapses on top of him. "This is MY BED, that COST ME. I'll sleep on it EVEN if you're in my way."

"I'm.... half naked though-"

"I DON'T *CAAAARE.*"

He stared blankly at her, she smelled of alcohol and cigarettes. Snoring on top of him, Ferdinand really wanted to move but he couldn't. So much touch and connection from a woman was something he was not familiar with, but he would spend this odd romantic time with her on the bed. Uncomfortable, Ferdinand would try to wrap his arms around Rila but she would push him over instead. 

"Nuh-uh. Get out."

He was now on the floor with sheer confusion and disappointment covering his face. He would spend a few minutes on the floor thinking. Later after finally getting dressed, he would notice his journal inside Rila's backpack. Embarrassment and panic struck, he's written and drawn many awkward things throughout his young adulthood in that journal. He opened it with tense hands, just to see Rila's annotations and doodles everywhere, on every page, on every line.

*ANNOTATION 1* - "I've always wanted to read this journal you've been keeping, you left it for me here? Thanks!" *(Doodle of Rila herself holding a heart)*

*ANNOTATION 2* - "So thick, so many pages, thanks for keeping it here for me I won't get bored at work." *(Doodle of her with nerdy glasses)*

"Oh dear..." Ferdinand looked, he scrolled through specific pages to see if she replied to those as well.

*ANNOTATION 48* - "SEEMS like I hit your type huh? You like goth fashion? CRAAZY COINCIDENCE. No wonder you're so weird around me, you like me! (Even though that was super obvious) I'm sorry about that whole panda rejection thing btw, sucks to suck." *(Doodle of her in a seductive pose holding a rose in her mouth)*

"This is not-" 

*ANNOTATION 62* - "Oh I knew you were bullied a lot, and I'm so sorry about that. Sending hearts and love from across time."

*ANNOTATION 77* - "Y'know if you ever feel so awful ever again, don't be afraid to hit me up, I'm here if you..."

In slight frustration, he closed the journal and put it back into her backpack. I REALLY don't need to read that. Disappointed that the whole journal was ruined, he felt a sense of relief. He felt like there was someone who genuinely liked and trusted him, but at the same time, he didn't really like her at all! So weird, so random, yet so full of knowledge and mystery. Love, beauty, she had it all, and he loved her! But she was so creepy, so weird, with ill intention on him. He hated her!

"Yo." She looked at Ferdinand who was in deep thought, "I forgot to tell you some things you should know."

"Aren't you sleeping?!" He yapped, confused.

"Nah." She yapped back. "So FIRST of all, 'grats on passing your exams, must've been a real difficulty to get by."

"Oh, thanks?" He was even more confused.

"Second of all, I'm free! They accepted my request to put me on the same rank as you, so now we both share the same schedule, sick right?"

He nods, "Sure..?"

"Third of all, our group is mandated to bond with each other to increase our combat effectiveness and bla bla bla. In short they just gave us some free time to spare with each other, like a high school friend group of some sort."

He nods again, understanding so far. "Uh huh."

"Fourth of all, CHRIST! You look like you barely slept?! *I mean so do I but honestly I was super busy this last night and such so like y'know I really shouldn't be shocked but also at the same time it's kinda wild since you often go to sleep at the right times and wake up like a regular morning bird chirping around and going to work barely getting to talk to me and others so like.*" She gasped to continue talking, "Fifth of all I forgot to mention, I'm sorry. On the first day we met I acted too much. I let my feelings get a hold of me with no self consciousness. So, that's why I got ourselves a room partition! *We'll still have to share the same bed though so I'm hoping you're comfortable with that."*

Ferdinand, thinking and staring, would be surprised by all this talk in the early morning. After going through so much thought his opinion on her began to fly back to the positive. After all, why wouldn't he want to give her a chance?

"I see, you don't really want to talk at the moment, I get it. I have another thing to mention but *yawn* I'd rather rest, and you too right? You can act like the sixth thing I wanted to say is that we have a free day today, so enjoy that while it lasts."

"Free day?" He would tilt his head with curiosity as he would look at Rila laying down on the other side of the bed.

"They got you to work during Sundays? Insane, because Sundays are free days for everyone. Good night, or good morning, I'm goin' to sleep." She would talk before tucking herself in with the comfy bed sheets.
He would stay silent, but also proceed to do the same. Ironically enough this would be their first time sleeping on the same bed together, but unlike how he would usually act around Rila, he felt normal. He was assured everything he thought was wrong, and so he thought of her differently. She was a friend, and he was her muse. 

-- *INTERMISSION* --

Rila walks into a dark, court-like room. six directors, each of different species with glowing glasses signifying who they are, judging her. Voices speak from the shadows, coming from nothing but glow.

"You've been trying too much to convince the cat. It is not hard to persuade a fan into our ways."

"You're pushing it too much, be slow, but reach it soon enough."

"In the script a calamity will soon follow, but not what we think. Guardian angels will come once again."

"Guardian angels."

"We must put every resource on that cat, contrary to the others."

"That cat is a regular, but with our discoveries, great things may follow."

"Rila, your mission, follow the path you chose. Your request has been accepted, you will be obliged to follow their command once more and work alongside the cat."

"Thank you, our efforts will not go in vain. For the Holy Earth, for everything." Rila kneels, and walks away into the darkness.
