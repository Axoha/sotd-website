-- *INTERMISSION* --

"These *intermissions*, hm."

**Now playing: "5th Symphony in C Minor - Ludwig Van Beethoven"

"I *believe* *SOMEONE* may be onto *me*."

It sat there, staring at its own older recording of a live opera. The talented musicians only reflected back to its eyes.

"How *comforting..."

**Now playing: AA-REC-414 "Same" 5718, October 22nd**

"Y'know Rila, from a scale of one to ten, what are the chances of me becoming an inventor, or some sort of researcher at the Holy Earth?"

"Five."

"Reason?"

**<<< REWIND**

"... becoming an inventor ..."

**<<< REWIND**

"... chances of me ..."

It sat there in its dark room, constantly rewinding and listening to Ferdinands' specific words, each second, each moment.

-- *INTERMISSION OVER* --

Rila walked into the control room of the CORE, majestically dressed in her usual ceremonial and honored black dress. The second mission was a brutal success. She stood before the screen and looked joyfully at the commander. 

"...You called?"

The commander turned around, her long coat flaunting. She smiled at the quick presence of Rila in a fancy dress.

"Yes I have captain. There was no need to dress as such - Celebration is still far from us."

"Quit the fancy speech Stella, it's just the two of us here. Just brief me on the script, you know exactly why I'm dressed like this." With a smirk she started smiling... 

...widely.

"Ah, so no drinks for us later. How unfortunate." She'd start tapping at the tablet that she held with her other hand, "Here it is."

They both looked at the giant screen, displaying texts of a very strange format.

"Of course, the resistance data you sent to us uncovered that the whole city square has an entire hijacked underground headquarters dedicated for them. We must continue to jab at it with the current group, the six directors strongly voted for only using your squad."

Rila stared at the screen with an immensely annoyed look.

"Hey, both of us know that's how the script goes."

"IT IS GONNA TAKE A WHOLE YEAR." She yelled.

A bit startled, Stella tried to look more towards the positive. "...Maybe you can find a way to accelerate the progress of the remaining two-hundred-forty-nine missions... no?"

Rila seethed, "No, I cannot."

"True, I guess, Ferdinand always has to be the main star to eventually become a weak vessel."

They both shared a moment of silence beneath the screen.

Stella adjusted her hat, "Well, Rila, I wish you luck on the date. I must continue working."

"Thanks..." She forcefully smiled, and walked back to the hallways.

She walked, she went to the surface, and she entered the fanciest restaurant on the richest block. Sat at her reserved table, poured and drank some red wine, waiting for Ferdinand. Right as she thought of him, he walked through the entrance, his curious little eyes following every shiny detail of the interior. Rila waved to him and he proceeded to sit across her, an awkward silent moment would ensue between them.

Nervously tapping on the table with his fingers, dressed in his fancy white tuxedo suit. He decided to finally break the silence with the most mind-blowing sentence ever conceived. 

"Um..."

"What's up, Ferdi?" She tilted her head, concern overshadowing her attractive expression.

"I thought you'd only... um... brief me on the upcoming mission while dressed fancily???" He spoke completely soaked in the sweat from his nervousness.

"Yup." She laid back a little on the chair, "That's exactly what we're gonna do."

Ferdinand, baffled, "This is a date."

She held her laughter, "And the previous road trips were not?" It has descended to chuckling.

He blushed, stared at her in silence for his realization, "I guess so."

Meanwhile Rila has found this so funny, she erupted into laughter. Spilling red wine all over the place on accident across the clean white table-coat, she gripped onto it as she hysterically laughed. Light tears flew from her eye, with a sudden impact she accidentally tilted the chair too much and fell onto the ground. Fancy people, dressed elite, stared at Rila's inner havoc as she continued manically laughing.

A waiter with a fancy moustache stood before Rila, "What is it gonna be, madam?"

Unnaturally, her expression changed to a more serious one in a split second. "Des steaks et des frites pour moi et le grand gars."

"Oui, merci." The waiter wrote on his little notebook and politely walked away.

Ferdinand, deciding to ignore and forget what just happened took deep breaths. He began to shift the situation onto a more laid back conversation, like as if he were on his first date. 

"Are you French?"

"No." She swiftly responded as she cleaned her mess and set the chair back up. "I'm Asian, I just control many languages."

"Fascinating..." He looked down, thinking of something else to say to break the silence, "What food did you even order, anyway?"

"Steaks and fries, I know you love those dearly." With a smug expression.

"...I do." He responded, looking at his own body a little bit ashamed.

"I FUCKING LOVE STEAK!!!" She yelled with the most motivated and exciting tone.

"Are you ok?" Ferdinand just looked at her with concern, his hands awkwardly on the table.

"No, Ferdi, I'm not..." Her face turned to sadness, "There is a lot that awaits us."

Ferdinand only grew more concerned and curious, "...That is?"

"TWO
HUNDRED
FORTY
NINE 
MISSIONS!!!" 

She yelled in an instant back at it with an energetic face, "THAT IS TRIPLE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MY PREVIOUS MISSION COUNT BACK FROM MY OLD CAREER."

"Rila, plea-"

She slammed her hands onto the table and stood up with fierce, "THIRTY YEARS AGO, WE ONLY HAD TO GO THROUGH LIKE WHAT?! TWENTY! THIRTY?! ME, ANd my friends, and my uh..."

She went silent. A little upset, she slowly backed down and sat again. "I'm sorry."

"It's o-"

"I flaunt my granted freedom too much." She continued to speak, "I can not help but always feel bad."

"Cuisines, madam." The waiter suddenly appeared once again, holding two dishes served with huge steak and fries.

"Merci, merci." She held her hands to her chest and thanked gracefully. She readied her fork and knife as the waiter walked away again, "We don't talk about anything what just happened, yes?"

"Correct." Ferdinand spouted, a little irritated by the whole dilemma. He cut a piece of the steak and slowly chewed on it, fully enjoying the taste.

"So about that next mission tomorrow morning, same thing as before, no big deal." Rila also cut herself a piece of steak and chewed on it blissfully.

"Two-hundred-forty-nine times?"

"Two-hundred-forty-nine times."

They both sighed, and so their dinner continued. Chatting about various other topics and their interests, their backgrounds and lives, it had really turned into a date.

**27/10/5718, 7:00**

--

"Ensure Ferdinand reaches his true potential with minimal injury, over."

With a beep, the commander stopped the transmission and patiently waited for the squad to move on. Awkwardness filled the room, the personnel looked very tired and bored, the directors no longer smiled with anticipation, but rather frowned with boredom. Stella took her glass cup of water and drank as she monitored her tablet.

"Here's to the happy second mission out of the two-hundred."

--

The main squad stood, waiting for the smoke to dissipate. Together they walked to the exit and stayed aware, Ferdinand couldn't resist to ask a question again.

"Are those civilians still locked down?" Questioning his surroundings with concern.

"They'll live." Rila answered as if she had no second to spare.

"I guess so."

They had reached the entrance to the underground sectors again, but instead of trying their best to fit through they'd rather plant explosives and remotely detonate them from a distance, for convenience. All four of them simultaneously jumped down onto the long hallway, immediately shooting a flare into the dark hallway, Rila has separated from them under the commanders order to defuse any traps set by the resistance. Ferdinand opened up the radio link to fill in the silence.

"Do you think there's a reason why they use so many tow hooks? It's starting to get annoying."

"Is it not obvious? They plan to take and study, fighting a war without knowing your enemy is a loss."

"WAR."

"Dudes I can figure, I'll have their database in no time."

And with a sudden radio change, Rila has switched to a private transmission with the control room.

--

"You're really allowing the squad to use the radio?"

"There is no need for stealth anymore. Using the radio falls into the positive since you'll be tracked and hunted, makes missions go by faster."

--

Rila came back from the vents and looked at Ferdinand and the rest of the squad just standing and chatting, and with swift thinking an idea followed.

"Ferdinand, I need you to hold your shield as tightly as possible and run into the hallways with us staying right behind."

He looked with a blank face, "Sure, anything for you."

"Good boy." She smiled widely, and forcefully pushed him into the front. He held to his shield and set off running with the rest of the squad following closely behind. Alarms immediately blared off, tow hooks automatically firing, metal doors slamming onto the cold rough floor. The hallways turned red, with flashing weak lights illuminating the space. Ferdinand busted through a door into an unknown room full of rebels, and the squad immediately went into action. Popping smoke grenades and taking cover from the storm of bullets, Hano and Ferdinand both looked at each other and silently agreed to rehearse their strategy. They both walked with Ferdinand covering Hano's minigun with his ballistic shield and efficiently mowed down the room. The room was clear and silent, with distant alarms still going off, and with heavy breaths and thrilled sweaty faces:

"Again?"

"AGAIN!!!"

Ferdinand hoisted his ballistic shield back up, and started rushing straight into another room again with the rest hardly keeping up. 

--

Back at the control room, as the commander quickly threw orders while the action was going on, something has been off. The third director was hearing unusual noise coming from the ceiling, and once he heard it again, he aimed his modified cannon arm to the ceiling and blew a hole. The sudden explosion has turned the attention of every personnel - including the commander to the dust filled center of the room. Something had fallen from the ceiling.

"KILL ME, AND YOUR WHOLE *OPERATION* WILL *CEASE*."

A robot, white and blue, from an unknown species with a huge hole in its chest. The smoke has cleared to the sight of the rusty machine with many duplicated arms pointing a gun from a distance to each important member of the room.

--

Suddenly without a commander to give quick tactical order from, the squad was left in a tough situation. Their weapon supplies were running low, their main mission unclear. Rila desperately tried to get back into contact with the commander, but without a response she ditched the whole thing and ordered for a retreat - too late. Ferdinand was struck with paralyzing bullets and was pierced through with a tow hook, and so has been Hano. Wall disappeared and Rila stayed behind hiding. The mission became a failure.
