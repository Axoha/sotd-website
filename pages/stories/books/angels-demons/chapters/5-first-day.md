Two days later without a warning, an order would flash on their phones with an unsettling sound playing. During the day of July 27th in the year 5718, everything would change for Ferdinand forever. Him, Rila, Hano, and Wall, each now with their portable phones issued by the Holy Earth would read the following highlight of the message.

"Dispatch experimental forces request confirmed. End the current disobedience."

An odd, cryptid message. The 'terrorist attacks' caused by an unknown part of society have gotten bad enough that they're calling in the hero forces. Rushing in, Ferdinand covered in sweat would run up to Rila's apartment room just to see her making omelets. 

"It's finally happening!" She'd turn her head to Ferdinand and grin with closed eyes.

"Well... you uh certainly aren't phased by this at all." Confused, Ferdinand would look at her and then fail to resist his urge to look at the omelets.

"Ferdi, I used to command and fight for these orders for a long time. Nothing phases me about this anymore."

"I mean... WHAT ABOUT ME?! I barely know how to shoot at targets! All those tactical strategies flew out of my mind! I'm doom-" 
His anxieties would be silenced by Rila placing her index finger on his lips.

"Trust your body, not your mind." 

"But I-"

"You know how to hold a gun, nothing to worry about! Simple as."

Ferdinand would look down with a frown on his face, and he'd proceed observe himself. Bulky, giant, he was starting to feel more confident in himself. Rila and Ferdinand would sit down at the table with two plates of omelets ready for both of them.

"I'm telling you, nuthin' to worry about. You will do what the command and I say, we will be suited with gear, each set built specifically for us. It should be pretty exciting after all for the first time, trashing bugs becoming well known." She'd take a pair of chopsticks and start eating.

"Bugs?" He'd freeze with question, hovering his fork above the omelets.

"Traitors, not literal bugs!" With her mouth full, she'd try to talk clearly.

"Ah, okay, got that, I really don't like bugs." 

They'd eat, Ferdinand's worry would slowly fade away as he ate. He'd think a lot, and finally came to retelling everything he knows in his head. Hero rank, the most prestigious role a person can have in the Holy Earth. Usually has advantageous mutations or is just a highly excelling soldier, these personnel arrive at tough situations to change the tide of conflict. Wearing the best of equipment suited for each member and their personalities, the 'Heroes' are pretty much unstoppable. However for this order, what if the terrorists are rebels with similar equipment and traits? Things could go really bad-

"You gonna finish that?" Rila would look at Ferdinand, who was in deep thought.

"No, thanks." Politely replying, he'd proceed to mutter to himself more.

Later they'd be sat in the car, driving across the silent city, Ferdinand would have his hand placed on his mouth. Wall sitting on his lap would stare at him again with those two beady eyes, however he wouldn't be phased this time. He'd think more about his memories and processes for orders like these. The Hero rank, after putting on their equipment would proceed to fit themselves into personal shells which would be shot into specific coordinates perfectly calculated. Sounds ridiculously dangerous, very inefficient, but there is an unlimited amount of power so there's nothing to really complain about. After, they'd take cover depending on their situation and listen to what the command says. Ferdinand would look through the windshield, the massive building, the CORE, would loom menacingly in the distance as the buildings of the city slowly dissipated. They'd reach the building, open the doors and walk together as a squad through the hollow darkness. Despite being here multiple times, this was all new for Ferdinand. They'd walk to the armory and inspect their given equipment for the first time.

SUBJECT 'Prince Hano Iviski' - Support, designed to stay in the back and heal. For his immense strength, he is fit with armor forged from the strongest of steel, and a exclusive long-range minigun with ammo fed using a backpack allowing for continuous fire for up to 3 minutes straight. Equipped with medical satchels along the armor, for emergency cases of a fallen Hero.

SUBJECT 'Walliem Galoool II' - Bullet, designed to corrode enemy defenses. 'BITEZ' axolotls are fast and deadly, only weapon provided is a tool that allows it to shift through short distance in a blink. Risky, but our predictions and calculations prove strong chances of success.

SUBJECT 'Ferdinand Raymond' - Frontline, designed to push forward. Ferdinand will be fit with a wide ballistic shield capable of taking extreme damage without a scratch and a pistol for emergency use. Thick and heavy armor with the highest head protection to ensure safe and effective pushes throughout missions.

SUBJECT 'Rila Jones' - Infiltration, designed to ensure safety and minimal death among Heroes. Equipped with a unique suit made of fabric that light can't pass through and a blade powered by the zero-point itself which can cut through remotely anything, infiltration was always successful. Previous records show extraordinary success, little to no change was needed from previous iterations.

"Back to the good old days." Rila would mutter to herself as she held the blade, so sharp, so shiny. "Did they even tell you about these roles during your training?" She'd ask across the whole room.

Ferdinand and Wall would look at her and silently shake their heads. "No, not in the slightest. It seemed more like a very celebrational promotion with little to no knowledge." Hano responded.

"I should've known." She'd lean against a wall sighing. "During this order you will listen to me and my commands, handling weapons and equipment should be easy for you by now. You will hold your positions until I tell you to move. I will be fighting alongside you, and if I see any disobedience you will be terminated on the spot." With a menacing tone in her voice, the rest of the squad would listen silently. She walked across the room, continuing her speech. "We will not be fighting people of soul, we will be fighting disgusting traitors who seek nothing but violence and chaos. Their equipment is of note, as many have been stolen from us and will be used. Our order is to clean that area of sin, and they trust us with such task. Do not disappoint."

"Yes, captain." Ferdinand and Hano would say in unison. 

Shortly after it would go quiet, the sounds of steel and banging would be heard as everyone would be busy suiting themselves up.. Ferdinand would inspect his shield with worry, but soon he'd feel the touch of Rila's hands on his right arm, and she'd lean close to him.

"I know how you feel, but there is nothing to fear. I'll be right besides you." 

He'd suddenly look to his right but there was no one. Feeling a little more ensured and a little creeped out, he continued trying to put on the thickest armor he had ever conceived.
After some time they'd finally be suited, and they walked together to the main elevator at the center of the CORE to the complex underground systems. So many people, so many computers, so much light, this is where the Holy Earth has been working in secret to keep their world fresh and alive. Together as a squad, fully armored, would walk across the main hall to the artillery system. It was a dark room with lots of belts and tunnels, Rila would use a computer screen to request shells and in almost an instant they'd slide in through one of the belts.

"All of you, fit yourselves inside one." She'd say as she was still on the screen configuring unknown things. They nodded and tried their best to fit inside. Wall would comfortably jump on the cushions inside the shells with ease, while Ferdinand and Hano struggled terribly because of their thick armor and size. Eventually, they'd agree to help each other and Ferdinand proceeded to try and fit Hano inside his shell. Success, however Ferdinand couldn't get inside his, he'd constantly try, until suddenly he'd feel a strong push to his back. He somehow got in and the doors automatically closed.

"Uh, thanks." Awkwardly responding as he got stuck in a very uncomfortable position.

"You're welcome." Rila looked at him through the little window on the shell, with that wide smile on her face once more.

What seemed like the last computer touches, Rila finally walked to her shell and comfortably squeezed into it with her slender body. Her shells' doors closed and the firing sequence began, alarms blaring and red lights flashing with the distant sound of mechanical belts. The shells would slowly move along the tunnel, each separated.

"This is extremely uncomfortable I feel like at death." A text message would appear for everyone in their shells as they were transported, this one was likely from Hano.

Ferdinand would try and squirm in the shell to reach his window screen "at least you arent upside down......." 

"EEGGGGGFFFYYYYYYHHHHHKKKK-" This one was a voice message definitely coming from Wall.

"Very funny." With a thumbs up emoji, Rila managed to silence the whole chat room.

The shells started gaining speed, going so fast until they abruptly stopped. Everyone felt the shell tilt, and with a sudden countdown on screen they all braced themselves for launch. Massive cannons would rise from the CORE, and the camera stream has begun for the directors and the command to see. Ferdinand tried his best to keep it cool, and before he knew it the shells launched one by one. The directors would watch in anticipation, grinning, this would mark the first day of the operation.

With a massive headache, Ferdinand looked around in his dark shell. Nothing was visible except for colorful lights which came from various small buttons. His ears were ringing, there were no sounds coming from the outside. "DO NOT DEPLOY." A voice message was heard with Rilas' voice. "Ferdinand, face your ballistic shield to the side of the window, locate it using touch. Your shield will automatically expand once in open space." Struggling to follow, he managed to locate the window and placed his left wrist which had the shield equipped against it. "Now, Ferdinand, deploy."
He pressed the red button, and suddenly flung up through the roof of the shell. A sound of a hundred guns all aimed at Ferdinand immediately started, with his shield deploying just in time. 

"Holding on? Great! Find Hano's shell while sustaining- "This is Holy Earth's command of the 720th division, hold position, do not go anywhere." HEY!" Rilas' voice was cut off by an unknown voice.

"Rila you are not permitted to give command anymore- "WHAT DO I DO?!??!?!" Ferdinand, hold position, reinforcements will arrive." 

The resistance's trench was heavily armed with machine guns, a total of eight constantly firing at the shield Ferdinand was holding with all his strength. The ballistic shield was bending and breaking, each bullet chipping a piece of it. Cyan dots appeared on each machine gunner and they would all be taken out in a synchronized rhythm. 

"Distraction successful, area is clear, deploy immediately." That unknown voice continued to speak, and Rila would come out of her shell with a mean look on her face. "You will be infiltrating the hijacked underground system, we must retrieve this sector back."

Ferdinand was frozen in place, and Rila dragged him behind rubble before they would shoot at him again. She was furious, her command was taken by some random stranger and she took that personally. 

"Oblige." With a bold tone the voice would speak to Rila. "Proceed to the entrance, Ferdinand must cover the front at all times. Rila must cover flanks. Clear the whole sector and make sure nothing stays alive, beware of long hallways and traps."

"Yes, commander." Sounding so defeated, she helped Ferdinand stand up so he can fulfill his current role. They slowly walked together in a straight line formation, right into the depths of the dark entrance which led to the overtaken underground system. 

"These bodies, this blood..." Ferdinand silently muttered to himself, exhaustingly walking towards the darkness and red lights. Rila found herself a proper vent to sneak through, and she proceeded to separate from the group and go alone. 

"I will find my way to the control room, you must proceed and find their main room."

The rest of the squad nodded and continued with their way across the maze. They'd come across a really long hallway, glints were spotted at the back in the darkness. Ferdinand swiftly faced his shield towards those glints and a loud shot was heard, which wasn't a gunshot. Hano grabbed Ferdinand by his arms to get him out immediately, but he failed. The tow hook tore through the ballistic shield, his left wrist was pierced and caught by the hook, he was dragged down across the hallway and suddenly everything went black for him.

**27/7/5718, 14:02**

Communication with 'Ferdinand Raymond' lost, awaiting next steps.

"Better training and equipment is required, this is unacceptable performance. Our instrument of war is gone, the whole project is a failure." The commander would speak directly to the third director, her tone agitated. 

"Silence. It is not over yet. You have not a clue to what you're handling here." Director Diriel, the mightiest director. His face masked, his body massive. He slowly walked towards the commander, his arms on his back, his sword sheathed. He placed his massive hand onto the commanders' shoulder. "Don't be a fool, we work with the paranormal."
.

"Ah, no ordinary 'Hero'." 

Ferdinand barely opened his eyes to the sight of a humanoid squid. He was tightly tied to a wooden chair, surrounded by many men of various species. This was the sectors' armory, with the racks and shelves, but the most important thing of note was the giant computer screen used to communicate with the CORE. The rebels took advantage and hijacked this sector of the underground just to access more information about the Holy Earth. The tow hook and the remaining half of his shield were still stuck to his wrist, but he felt no pain, he felt numb in his mind.
Rila on the other hand would sneak in through vents, slicing things if they obstructed the way. With surprise she encountered no-one, it was empty, not even in the control room. She shut down any electronics in the sector using the main computer, and made a status report to the commander with an agitated voice of course. Hano and Wall were ordered to leave the sector, and Rila was sent to somehow retrieve Ferdinand's body. Before however she set the whole sector to an emergency mode as commanded which would close any and all exits, doors, entrances with the thickest armor.
The rebels in the armory were trapped, their reinforcements somehow vanished. There was supposed to be defense all around, but there wasn't. Ferdinand looked around the room, it was only dim red. So dark, the pain finally started to set onto him, and when he felt the touch of a rebel he impulsively reacted. His reflex tore off the arm of the chair, and his right arm was free. He clawed his ropes out and was completely free. The rebels tried to shoot him at the spot but their weapons weren't working due to radiant power being cut off. Ferdinand stood, and he moved his wounded left arm.
Rila would run across the hallways, occasionally stopping to slice off the metal barricades blocking her way. Room after room, no luck, clean as usual. She'd mutter to herself hoping he'd still be alive or at least here, and all her hopes were answered in the armory.

"You assume too much commander." The third director spoke over Rila's camera footage. The room was bloody red, so gory. "Everyone has always assumed too much about him."

Ferdinand stood still at the center of the room, for he had successfully completed his mission and survived.
