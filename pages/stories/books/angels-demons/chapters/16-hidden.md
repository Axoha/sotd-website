December, the most cherished month of the year. Artificial snow began to fall and cover the ground of the cities with a thin layer, the wastelands still looked the same however. Ferdinand sat cozily on his bed and looked out the window of his new room, which was now placed among the top floors of the Core. He had nothing to do at the moment, so he chose to dust off his old journal and start writing.

**1/12/5718**

*"Two months have passed since I became a symbol of peace among the people. My life has took a direction I never thought I'd go through, people love me. It has also been two months since Rila's disappearance, and the assembly of my left hand - which is now a giant clunky golden arm. I met a strange person who's name goes by AUTO, apparently the designer behind my arm. He's like as if I had a little twin brother, that was also from a species I do not know, and who also loves to invent things. Every week during one morning I always wake up to his special new prototype for an 'Alarm Clock' that he gradually continues to improve despite me often yelling to not do that - he never listens. His last prototype for the clock was some sort of contraption with an old-timey phone hanging from a string emitting a weird noise inside a metal cylinder, yeah I don't know. Sometimes it's hard to believe that this little buzzing guy was behind the intricate design of my arm."*

He turns to a blank page to continue writing.

*"I haven't been called to meet the Directors for a long time, the only important events that have transpired in the last month have just been me practicing with AUTO lazily sitting on the ground coaching me. My arm is not just a prosthetic, it is a weapon capable of physical power that straight up breaks sound barriers. It took me a while to figure out how the things and stuffs work, but I think I have a proper hang of it by now. Have I mentioned yet that it is December? I've been outside ONCE for the two months and they're still not letting me out of the Core during my break. Maybe it's 'cause I'm too popular now... but I'm hoping I at least get to visit my mom, catch her up on how I've been, and most importantly to say sorry."*

Knock knock.

Ferdinand's ears perked up as he heard knocking on his door. He lousily walked towards the door to open it, expecting yet another security check-up. He opened the door to and saw her, the girl.

Rila stood calmly and slightly raised her hand to wave. "Hi."

He stared at her and slowly tilted into the floor, Rila grabbed him and put him back into a non-fainting position. He simply could not believe his wide eyes, Rila stood before him perfectly unchanged and normal just as ever. She held a bouquet of roses and suddenly handed it to him as a gift. 

"I can't believe-"

"It's for you!" She smiled widely, holding the bouquet of roses packed together in crumpled brown paper.

"It's for me..." He held the bouquet in his hands, looking at the signature tag on the paper. It was from an old flower store from the city where he came from. 

"Where have you been?"

"Don't sweat it." Rila scoffed, "I was called for an operation and you know how time goes. Those two months here was only a week for me."

Ferdinand looked at the flowers again, and then looked back at her. "I would've greatly appreciated it if you told me before..." His expression shifted towards sadness, "I recognize these bouquets, I really could have gone with you."

Rila's eyes widened, she was not expecting such a depressing reaction coming from Ferdinand. She held his hand and leaned closer to him, gradually comforting him. "Next time, I'll try my hardest to manage something perfect for you."

Minutes between them has passed.

"Where's Auto?" She asked.

"He was just called for some meeting with the Directors, common, and inconvenient."

The Director's hall, a massive underground space laid with reflective black floor and minimal light. Huge pillars held the space of this empty darkness, and the Director's each stood before Auto to discuss a severe threat. Trillions of planets, millions of galaxies, dozens of timelines have fallen from their control in what seemed like an instant. There was an incoming threat, which the Holy Earth's armies couldn't defend from.

Rila continued to taunt, distracting Ferdinand removing his thought with single manipulations. She gave him the life he had always wished for. Rila grabbed Ferdinand's hand and together they walked once more into the garden they have been a long time ago along the snowy path, a massive tree stood decorated with bright ornaments. People sang and held hands together around the tree. Love, love, love, silent night. Ferdinand felt a grip on his hand as he looked at Rila, who was staring blankly at the beautiful tree, her hand was cold.

"My *body* is something *I do not know* myself of." Auto spoke into the darkness. "My *home* was a *torturous* labor. You MUST let me undo my *doing*."

One of the Directors spoke back, "Why must we have faith in you?" A voice booming.

"I am a machine made to construct the *POWER SOURCE*. Without *it*, this *threat* will not exist anymore. I know the *weakness.*"

A Director opened their mouth, but in an instant their mouth was wrapped with chains. The Seventh Director stood up, he was colossal, his screen reaching up to the bare ceiling. The six gills lit up with a white glow and static began screeching from his screen. A face appeared, an unfamiliar head barely visible through the static.

"AUTO, I entrust to you the script. You may be held in power of the Director."

Bewildered by his odd decision, every director, without a choice stood up and hailed. For the Holy Earth and everything that has ever existed.

Later that day.

The Holy Earth's army waited before a platform, millions of soldiers well equipped with armor and an all round energy rifle firmly stood. The flags drop down and hang from the walls, blissfully showing their symbol of religion. The Seventh Director, with heavy robotic footsteps that seemingly crushed the floor beneath him, walked towards his pedestal. From his sight he took a moment to coldly stare at his wasteland. The soldiers stood firmly, the vehicles were at bay, and the giant capital ships took afloat in the skies heavily armed.
He began his speech. His role ominous and powerful, yelling and boosting the might of his military. The capital ships have begun their onslaught upon their targets, instantly travelling into their designated planets from different timelines and obliterating them, foe or not. This massive sacrifice would form a gap between the Holy Earth and the incoming threat, and they would just have enough time to begin Auto's secret operation. Nobody would care for this loss, as Holy Earth's outer rings are typically scrap planets for the poor to hold.

Ferdinand and Rila basked in joy as they both danced, romance filled both of their hearts and they held each other closely. Ferdinand was unaware, his mind was in peace and blind happiness.

*Ferdinand*, this following operation I have told you about may sound *bizarre*, but I *plead* for assistance.

Brother, we might not know much of each other yet, but I'll always be on your side.

Thank you, bring the lady in too. We will be following *my script.*
