The lines of the future and the past drew thin.

Akimi continued to fall through the void, the chains were freed from his leg and he flailed trying to grab his transmitter. Upon grabbing it however, he landed on a hard floor with a loud thud. There was no light, everything was pitch-black around him.

"*I believe we have never properly met.*"

Like thunder, a voice came from the void, echoing to no end. Akimi swiftly came to his sense, quickly nabbing the transmitter and stuffing it into his bag. He looked around quickly, until he saw a static screen light up with it's six gills. The giant made of wire remained seated, and Auto in his black and white scheme appeared floating next to the Seventh's torso, his wings glowing. Spotlights turned in a synchronized matter, revealing that Akimi was at his throne room his size comparable to a feeble worm. He readied his fists, staring down at the Seventh ominously sitting on the throne.

During the present, Ferdinand poured his raw emotion at Emilia. She struggled to breathe, scratching at his golden arm with desperate intent of survival. Ferd ran up to both of them, but before he could get Ferdinand to notice him they were gone in a flash. Ferdinand extruded wings from his back and flew above the city with Emilia in his grasp. He let go of her, punching her directly into the streets of the city. Slammed against the road, breaking the asphalt, she struggled to stand up from such force. Ferdinand descended and landed, creating a loud impact. He slowly walked towards her as he readied his golden fist. Emilia gestured with one of her arms telling him to stop, she exclaimed to him telling him to wait, but her signals fell on deaf ears. He swiftly appeared before her and swung with his fist, her reflex transferring all her strength to one arm so she can block it. Her body retaliated with a hand of dark matter from her body aimed directly to his eyes, but he was swift to react, grabbing it with his other arm right before it was about to hit him. There was no fighting back, Emilia evaded his next strike and ran away. Ferdinand overpowered her in every aspect; speed, force, knowledge, and endurance. He always appeared before her with a flash, but she managed to always dodge, except for one time where he grabbed her face and slammed her directly into the concrete. He was ruined, driven by mad emotion.
Not a long ago, the morning of the day when Ferd was born, Ferdinand himself decided to speak to the Directors. He had no idea what was happening to him, it seemed like as if every single terrible event coincidentally lead up one after another. He walked to the conference hall, and to his surprise only one Director sat at highest spot.

"*I believe you have never seen me before.*" An ominous voice echoed, the doors shut behind Ferdinand as he stood at the center of the spotlight.

"I have never." He replied into the darkness.

"*I am the Seventh, I am the one who has brought the Holy Earth together.*" White details on his body emitted light, giving him a slight hint of what he is. "*I have long awaited the day we would finally meet.*"

"Why have we never met sooner?" He asked the darkness.

"*The six Directors, simple enforcers of my rule, have been taking my rule and order.*" The Seventh spoke in riddled lies, "*I am too powerful, they said, restricting me from the position I sit upon.*"

Ferdinand turned silent and thought.

"*I have been eager to talk with you. Ask me anything you desire, I will answer as I know it all.*" The void spoke.

"What has been going on with me?" He asked more questions, "Why does it feel like the Holy Earth is turning against me?"

"*You have been sustaining their abuse.*" The Seventh replied, "*That is their order, to start anew, to slowly kill you.*"

Ferdinand stood in shock, the twist felt like a stab. He was silent, the Seventh awaited another response, slowly observing his behavior.

"What happened to my mother?" Oddly, he asked.

"*I bear the news with a heavy heart.*" He spoke, "*She was violently murdered by the hand of Rila, three months ago.*"

"I don't believe that." Ferdinand was sure.

"*Every armor this place manufactures is equipped with a camera for archival footage.*" The Seventh swiftly replied, "*I do not advise, but you may look.*"

Ferdinand, with a determined breath, decided to look. The Seventh, his head a massive screen, leaned down and position itself in an unnatural way. The footage played amidst the silence, and Ferdinand watched in complete despair as he saw his mother die.

"I don't believe that..." He murmured, his soul crushing as he began to connect the dots.

**During the past.**

"*I am the Seventh, I am the one who has brought the Holy Earth together.*" The Seventh spoke from his throne, holding a hand to his chest, "*I will watch your battle with pride.*"

Auto, the Seventh's right hand man was sent to smite Akimi. He used his wings to dive with a long glowing trident in his hands, landing in front of him with a strong impact. A battle would ensue that would determine their fate. 
Auto began with swift jabs using the trident, but Akimi evaded each with clever slides and rolls. He was dangerously inexperienced with the gauntlet, relying on skills he had learned from the three years of orders. Auto figured it was not effective, he threw the trident with a dire attempt to hit him and fabricated two gauntlets for himself equipped right around his hands. Akimi got close enough to swing a punch, but Auto managed to counter his attack just in time with a quick punch to the gut. Auto threw more hits, using kicks and punches efficiently and swiftly to not allow Akimi counter in any way. He began to predict his moves, he'd figure that if Auto could fabricate objects so could *he*, and with a concentrated thought he opened his palm and generated a flash. It temporarily stunned Auto, giving Akimi just enough time to fabricate a simple machete made of diamond. He rushed back at Auto who regained his sense, who instantly blocked his swing with his two palms of the gauntlets. The diamond machete shattered under the pressure.

"You have played too much of video-games, it shows." Auto smugly responded.

Akimi was slightly distracted by the response, but he continued his relentless assault, successfully lodging the hilt of the machete into Auto. He kicked Akimi far, dislodged the hilt off of his shoulder and began fabricating more weaponry. Akimi quickly got up, created weapons, and ran straight into him. Before they were about to clash again, they were abruptly stopped by the Seventh, their legs and arms chained.

"*Your inexperience is painful to watch, both of you.*" The Seventh stood up and approached them, his footsteps loud and mechanical.

Akimi squirmed, bound by the chains, Auto was freed and he instantly flew aside the Seventh. He felt the cold wire surround him, the Seventh picked him and turned to face him in his grip, slowly freeing him from his chain. Akimi took the moment to observe his body, of course, he had to target the heart somehow.

"*I expected you to die, but you seemed to find another way around. The script remains the same.*" The Seventh examined him with his other hand, "*You will never reach the surface, despite such valiance, what a shame.*"

Once Akimi figured a plan, he raised his gauntlet and opened the palm to generate a huge explosion. Despite harshly injuring him, he was free from the Seventh's grasp, and as he fell he grabbed onto his chest and tore off the armor plating and wire to reveal his beating heart, the core. He leapt out as his injury slowly healed, Auto tried to intercept him but was blinded yet again by Akimi's flash. He ran for the trident that Auto threw and grabbed it, intending to penetrate the Seventh's heart with it by a throw. He charged his gauntlet, he ran, he set himself for a throwing stance, this was it.
The Seventh was stunned, but a conscious remained in him. He reached his arm out into a portal and chained Emilia from the future into his grasp. He stretched out his arm and held Emilia right in front of the trident's supposed trajectory, right in front of Akimi. He stopped, he dropped the trident in disbelief, and at his moment of distraction Auto managed to stab him from the back with a spear. Emilia was thrown aside by the Seventh as he approached Akimi.

"*The only way you would have achieved victory is if you stayed with her*." The Seventh spoke with a thundering voice, "*But you did not, you put your beliefs and ideals first, what a shame.*"

Akimi looked down, the tip of the spear through his chest. He looked at Emilia, who was incomparably bewildered and confused.

"*I applaud to you, that was a very brave set of acts, but you would not have killed me anyway.*" He leaned down to Akimi, "*For I am an Angel, too.*"

Ferd appeared next to Emilia in the background, who looked at Akimi before he vanished with Emilia back into the future.

"*That meaning, I cannot kill you.*" The Seventh continued his speech, "*You chose to live, you will live forever as a cursed soul. Farewell, you offered the most enjoyment I had in millennia.*"

And with it, all went dark, and Akimi appeared back at his camp. The sun slowly from the horizon and Akimi quickly scoured his backpack for the transmitter. He was still injured, but the fear and adrenaline from what had just occurred brought him to swift fumbling. He began to quickly type in separate messages, alerting Laura of the script, but before he could even explain what happened, his body vanished with the light from the sun. The transmitter fell and tumbled down a cliff breaking more with each impact.

Back in the present, Ferdinand looked over the city from the skies. Emilia somehow disappeared from him without a trace, his soul would not rest about it for the rest of the night.


**ACT IV CHAPTER VIII - THE COMING END OF AN ERA**

Gabriel and Auto sat together at the top of a skyscraper, their feet dangling miles above the streets of the Holy Earth. They talked, observed their surroundings, and ate cookies. The wind howled with strength and whistles.

"Your life doesn't make sense." Gabriel suddenly began to talk amidst the ambience.

"What do you *mean* by that?" Confused, Auto responded, "Living for *millennia* is not normal, but I don't *understand* why my experience would be *illogical*."

"Your reaction to the Angel's chamber contradicts your acts twenty years ago here, for example." He quietly talked.

"I do not *understand.*" He replied.

"Do you have no recollection of you being right by the side of the Seventh Director?" Gabriel tilted his head and asked.

Auto's eye widened, he shuddered, "No."

They both turned their heads to look at the horizons of the gilded city, Gabriel spent his time thinking.

Every day looked normal, yet, for some reason it felt like the end of the world was bound to happen soon. Unease grew in the populations due to recent events of Ferdinand confronting Rila in a fight, harshly damaging several buildings and streets. Reports occurred on civilians missing, as if they have just vanished into thin air for the past few months. Nothing was looking good, not for the leaders, not for the Directors. They were at a time of peace, without any substantial threat looming over them, but were those all just more fabricated lies to ignore the existence of the script?
Ferdinand, a week later was personally invited by the Seventh himself to watch an Opera. He arrived earlier before the show commenced during the night, dressed in a white suit laced with golden rims. As usual he'd be photographed and cheered for as he was a true hero among the people after all, but he was unresponsive, focused, expressionless, holding just a firm cold stare.

"*You have arrived right on time.*" The Seventh spoke right after Ferdinand passed the doors. It would be just both of them in an exclusive room, with two seats and a grand view at the stage.

"Why was I invited here." Ferdinand asked with a murmur.

"*You have been fighting crime, executing dissidents for days.*" He spoke, "*I thought you would enjoy some rest.*"

"I cannot rest." Ferdinand coldly replied.

The Opera began, a line of instruments were revealed and a performer walked up to the front. She began to sing, a beautiful melody echoed through the space. Everyone was seated silently, listening, looking, feeling emotion. The performer sang with their whole heart out, tears strolling down her face as she hit the highest notes. Ferdinand, despite such emotional performance, still remained the same, but he was focused nonetheless. Once the performance ended, claps roared through the crowd. The performer bowed and smiled, walking away shortly after for a break.

The Seventh looked to Ferdinand, who remained sat with a frown, "*Was that not magnificent?*" He asked.

"I suppose so." Ferdinand replied.

"*I have plans for the Holy Earth you may be interested in.*" The Seventh suddenly talked, instantly catching Ferdinand's interest. "*I may let you soak in your engineers' dream.*"

And with that, he unsheathed a screen to which he broadcasted blueprints on. Simply put - They were huge machines, labeled as 'SPEARs'.

"What am I looking at here." Ferdinand answered, not knowing the real purpose for the plan.

"*These are organic machines powered by our source to be piloted by a single person.*" The Seventh raised a finger, "*With this the Hero rank may finally be abolished, souls will be set free. A new system will be put in place.*"

Ferdinand observed the plans more, he began to slowly understand. A change like this would change everything regarding the military, less lives would be wasted this way. What he questioned, however, was how something like this didn't go through within the past three-thousand years before. He did notice flaws with the designs, and spouted some of his personal suggestions to the Seventh, who gladly accepted his speeches. The opera continued sooner and they both watched and listened again.

Meanwhile, somewhere far.

Ferd stood at the rooftop of the apartment building, he looked at the stars, the streets, with a frown. Emilia walked up and sat next to him. The Core emitted a strong beam of light for seemingly no clear reason, they both watched as the light reflected upon their eyes.

"Today is the last day, I know it." Ferd exclaimed, clutching his hand to his chest.

"W-what do you mean by that?" Struck with confusion, she asked.

"I can hear the distant voices of people, Angels disguised under a mask offering them to hold their hand." He continued, "Something terrible is bound to happen very, very soon."

"I was never told what would happen after you were born." Emilia talked, "Do you know?"

"No..." Ferd talked with tinted sadness, "If the worst comes, I will hold your hand."

"What does that term mean?" She asked more.

"Angels may be sent to pick a person to ascend into the unbound, a place above all." He murmured, "But I don't want to do that, I don't want to return there."

"Why not?" Curiosity consumed her more.

"Life that exists here is much more beautiful, the people here are full of emotions and soul." Little tears began to form around his eyes, "I don't want the Angels to destroy this world and begin anew! People should not have their lives cut short at the fault of a select bad people!"

His emotions broke out and he fell into Emilia's grasp, he cried in her shoulder. She comforted him with a tight warm hug, brushing over his back and head with her hand.
