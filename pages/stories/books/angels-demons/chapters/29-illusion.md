Weeks after the disastrous Angel attack on the Holy Earth during the year 5699 society repaired itself on a strong pace. Akimi wandered the wastelands with a bag that held all his needs, undercover from the Holy Earth's security. One day his transmitter rang, and to his relief he received a message from a friend, Laura. Akimi rest his back on a boulder and began typing on the transmitter, asking questions, general talk. She talked about her journey on regular earth. Upon arrival she was in absolute shock, the agents didn't even have to ask for any credentials or reason, the status of the Holy Earth at that time justified any and all rash "evacuations". She was safely escorted to her city of origin New York, managing to rent an apartment after a whole day of searching and struggle. Months have passed, she apologized a lot for not replying on the transmitter sooner, but Akimi didn't mind, those months were just a few weeks for him. She also managed to find a job, make friends, and live comfortably in general despite expecting birth in only a couple of months. Laura asked him what happened on the other side and how he is doing, but he struggled to reply. He couldn't explain, his hands shook.

"Me and Emilia are out here looking for a way, we made it out safely." He replied to her text message.

Laura was delighted to hear the news, but Akimi froze. He wondered why he'd type that even though the worst has actually happened. He excused himself, put down the transmitter and looked at the Core from the mountains. An idea struck to him, and so he began to scheme a plan.

During the present day, Emilia walked with Ferd into the capital city. They stopped by many places, Ferd would often touch any security systems like turrets to turn them into glowing butterflies, giggling at the insects flying off into the sky. Emilia looked through her bag for her keys to the old apartment, and walked into the building where she used to live a while. She found her old room and settled down to rest. She sighed and laid down on the bed.

"Mom." He quietly spoke as he also laid down next to her, "Why exactly did I come here?"

Emilia continued to look at the ceiling, "What do you mean by that?" She asked.

"I was fabricated, I know that." He continued to speak, "But I don't understand why."

"I was ordered to create you, for reasons that I don't know." She looked at him, "I used to follow a script created by the Seventh, order after order. The creation of you was the last step that I've known, there was nothing next."

It was a bit silent after.

"I wonder why you have red hair." She spoke to break the silence.

"Does it remind you of someone?" He asked.

"Unfortunately." Emilia told him slowly.

More silence occurred.

"You should take off the mask." Ferd suddenly suggested, "It's not good for you."

"I'm afraid I must keep it." She looked back at the ceiling, hands knit together on her stomach.

"I've seen your whole life." He looked at her with his big eyes, "A life defined by tragedy."

"Don't talk about that." She swiftly responded.

"I sense struggle within you, I just wanna help." He replied, turning back into the ceiling.

"I had to live through my life again around a week ago, I believe I have known and seen enough." She calmly talked.

They both stared at the ceiling, laying down on the bed in the same posture. Deep in thought, they rest themselves as the traffic below made noise.

"I never thought I'd be in a situation like this." She scoffed, "I regret everything I've ever done."

Ferd only looked back at her.

"I don't know what I should do next." She frowned, "I just don't know what to do anymore."

Ferd held her hand and looked at her, "I forgive you for everything you've done."

Emilia was confused at the act, but she felt her tension slowly fade. She looked at him, who just smiled.

"You need to get me to Ferdinand." He spoke.

**During the years of 5699.**

Akimi spent weeks, months, figuring out the exact way he would put an end to the Holy Earth's rule, they must've been stopped. He had stacks of paper and notes he would connect and intertwine for theories, writing everything with a thick red marker. He'd think more at his camp, constantly thinking about the plan. Somedays he'd talk to Laura through the transmitter, he did tell the actual story of what happened eventually, but what mattered more at the time were her status updates. Laura lived a life of a single mother, claiming it wasn't "too bad" despite sometimes writing paragraphs on how it's very bad, but in general they shared nice moments texting for hours end.
The Angel's shell still remained on the surface, heavily guarded and secured, but Akimi still managed finding a way to sneak in and observe the shell from close distances. It leaked it's light matter upon touch, and he managed to snag samples before sneakily getting out without harm. There wasn't much to do with it other than just stare at it glow, so he had no choice but to infiltrate the Core and grab appropriate tools.

*But he ended up finding something more.*

Steel rooms of the same chambers that were built to fabricate and experiment with light matter. There was one particular room that stood out, simply labeled as "Ferdinand Ray". The label alarmed him, it shared the same name as Laura's son. Curious, he entered to investigate. It was dusty to surprise, the terminals seemed very dated, and the room was just weird, outlandish. He turned on the main machine only to be booted by a flashing warning pop-up.

"*Locked until further notice. **Follow the script.***"

He was confused, a new odd key has been found for his theories. He looked around more within the room, until he figured the tiled floor could be pressed and moved aside, there were more dusty and dark hallways. He slowly walked, to his surprise there were no cameras, no lights.

"*AKIMI*, is that *correct?*" A voice sounded, "I *thought* only **I** could walk *around here*."

"Who, where?!" Akimi yelled out into the darkness.

The voice blinked once, and light came from it's eye, "I am *AUTO*, the Seventh's *Right-Hand Man*."

"Aren't you from the Bastion?! You're working with the Directors?!" Akimi was bewildered.

"I work with only *ONE Director*, the *Seventh*." He began to speak, "I found myself *here* from the *outer reaches of space*, an *escapee from the Bastion*. I was called here by *my heart* for a *greater purpose*, for a *chain of events* I must *be in*."

"I don't understand, what are you talking about?" He was invested.

"Follow *me*." Auto calmly spoke.

They walked through the dark hallway, Auto's eye illuminating the way. Their footsteps echoed without an end.

"*The Seventh knows all*, speaking in a *cryptic language* that *tells the future*. *Three-Thousand* years ago *the Seventh* conjured ***the script***, a *long game to end life* as we know it to *begin a pure existence*. ***Destroying the repetition***, *the Seventh* calls it." He spoke coldly, "Now tell *me*, how did you find *your way here*?"

"I-" Akimi was abruptly cut off.

"I do *not* need to *know*, there is *not* a reason to *ask*. We can *look at the script together.*"

Akimi was uneased, Auto opened a heavy reinforced gate that revealed a massively spacious room with a single spotlight illuminating a table that seemingly had a project on it.

"*Come sit by the table*." Auto quickly spoke.

He was hesitant, but compliant. The whole scene made him frightened, the pitch-black darkness surrounded both of them.

"Let us check the *receipt*." A massive screen flashed in front of them both, there were symbols and undecipherable text.

"What are these tools on the table?" Akimi asked.

"That is for the *last phase of the script*, future property of *both Ferdinand and Ferdinand Junior*. Still a *work-in-progress*." He looked at the screen, "Would you want me to read *the script* for *you*?"

Akimi was hesitant, he was scared by what could possibly be written in it, but despite it all he agreed.

"*Splendid*, I will *skip* to the *last phases* for the *sake of relevance*."

Akimi stared at the screen blankly, without a word to say. The eight gauntlets laid on the table in front of him, with the divine golden arm that would soon belong to Ferdinand Ray.

"*There is a lot more detail*. It is *long*, but *those* were *the main keys*." Auto slowly turned and coldly spoke.

Akimi continued staring, he could not just sit by and let this happen. He reached out for his bag and noticed the light matter he had stored since his expedition, he thought for a long moment. 
Eventually, he has decided to risk his life, slipping one of his hands into a gauntlet, infusing it with the light matter he had stored. Auto swiftly reacted to the sudden act of betrayal, turning his arm into a spear to lodge into him. Akimi covered himself with the gauntlet, protecting him from the strike. He threw a punch to kill him, but he swung and he was gone. The gauntlets, far weaker than the golden arm, were built for adaptability and efficiency. He ran back to the surface navigating through the labyrinth, fumbling his hands trying to turn on his transmitter to share the news with Laura immediately. He saw an exit, but upon opening it his leg was chained and he was dragged into darkness.

Emilia, together with Ferd waited at the rooftop of the Core. She was worried, but he reminded her to be brave. She sent Ferdinand a message to meet up here, to tell him the truth together with Ferd. He appeared, walking up the stairs looking down. Ferd hid behind a concrete block to not shock him instantly, and Emilia braced herself, she leaned against the railings and looked at the city. Ferdinand would also join in, his giant body loomed over her as he leaned next to her, he was without a word.

"Ferdinand." She broke the silence, "I need to tell you everything."

Ferdinand only slightly looked at her, he was expressionless. It unnerved her significantly.

"I- It's a lot to -"

In a flash Ferdinand grabbed her by the throat with the golden arm, she choked, the grip on her skin turned black.

"You were gonna tell me you lied to me the whole time?! THAT YOU KILLED MY MOTHER?! THAT YOU FORCED ME THROUGH HORRORS?! THAT YOU VIOLATED ME?!"

He continued to choke her, his grip on her frozen.

"You can't fool me anymore..."
