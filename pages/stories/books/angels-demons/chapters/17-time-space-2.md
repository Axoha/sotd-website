Three-thousand years ago during the first communication between the species of the Multiverse, there were no lifeless, it was a species erased from the Holy Earth's record. They were the Bastioners, a civilization of limbless organic creatures who have evolved and enhanced their bodies to advance. At the very edge of the timeline cluster they resided in a faction known as The Bastion, having the whole universe for themselves and them only, like a virus that had successfully spread across entire space. They were especially centered around evolution, expansion, and technological advancement. The rest of the main multiversal species grew quite curious towards them specifically during the first communication, and it was because the Bastioners did not hold an angel in their hands.
Years later after the seven main timelines unified their earths into the Holy Earth, the Bastioners were treated lowest. Every species could share the wealth but them, their marvelous cyborg bodies have been used strictly just for work, slaving away their lives for the prosperity of the rich. Once during a political discussion that was held in the public among the crowds in front of the Core, a human representative spoke to a Bastioner that represented them. The slaves who were put on the top to represent their species had to lie without a choice, but one Bastioner was not to be silenced anymore. With a gunshot their whole plot that was planned for years would finally begin. The Bastioners who were put at the top sacrificed their lives executing the higher ranks of the Holy Earth, and those who were enslaved escaped back to their home. The public was in mass panic, the Bastion representative had executed every other political figure with its multiple arms holding a firearm. The Holy Earth suffered through a devastating loss, but the worst was yet to come. A monster that shined just as brightly as the sun emerged through the Core, its tentacles spread out throughout the sky and screeched, destroying everything that has come its way. The tentacles pulsed and waved in the sky erasing those unholy, reports flashed everywhere about the seventh zero-point missing, it was only clear that a Bastioner had somehow absorbed the power of an angel.

"Ah, *FERDINAND*, I'm kind of worried you'll be *scarred* for *life* after this." Auto's buzzing voice suddenly rang out amidst the silence in-between the ambient sounds of travelling in a ship headed towards a space station.

"Can't believe this'll be your first time going to actual war Ferdi." Rila spoke right next to him, her perfume was strong.

"Don't kill me for this but I'd really appreciate *another* briefing, I simply just cannot fathom whatever is going on here..." Ferdinand laid back.

Both Rila and Auto groan, it was about to be the third time he would be briefed on the coming script.

"*The Bastion* is an untrustworthy plague on *these realities*, who specialize on *EVOLUTION* and *EXPANSION*. For the past few millennia's the Holy Earth have been fending off The Bastion from the timelines. We will be joining this *HIDDEN WAR* because they have *SOMEHOW* breached through every defense our force has, and we will sneak right into their *capital* to stop this *MADNESS*."

A moment of silence suddenly occurred, Ferdinand held his chin and pondered for a bit.

"You come from this Bastion species right?"

Both of them exclaimed with an "Oh my GOD." It was the most obvious thing yet he could not get it into him. Auto was about to continue briefing more, but as he raised his finger he only stared at Rila and Ferdinand who were very close to each other.

"Darling' you ask too many questions. Trust the wind and let it guide you." Rila softly spoke closely to Ferdinand and Auto looked at the action with unexpressive disgust.

With an abrupt bump, the transport ship has finally docked. They walked in dimly lit hallways next to the reinforced windows that showed a true beauty of the cosmos. The sight of a unfamiliar planet right below their feet has left Ferdinand completely mesmerized. The three of them walked, until Ferdinand started walking slower eventually stopping to take in the true sight.

"What is the *deal*? I *thought* this was *a common occurrence* for *mortals* these days." Auto bent his hands and placed his hands on his hips.

"I've never actually seen space." Ferdinand breathed in. "This whole time I was at the Holy Earth without a clue of how deep it actually is. It brings me back to my childlike wonder, my old dreams."

Auto stood next to him and thought, also staring at the stars. "It is as if the *cosmos* is talking back to my thoughts. *Funny*. Perhaps *someday* we could share our *dreams*, or what the *cosmos* told us if so."

Rila walked up to Ferdinand, laying her arm on his shoulder. "The people out there need us, let's go."

Ferdinand looked at her a bit dismantled, immediately knocking his sense back. "Yeah right, right."

The trio continued to walk through the station, room by room, each door a peek into what the Holy Earth is up to. Automated machines fabricated tools of war, a diverse group of four equipped them right around, who soon fitted themselves in a shell and launched themselves into the atmosphere of the planet below.

"You remember those procedures right? How nostalgic." Rila spoke without looking back at Ferdinand as they walked.

"I remember..." He quietly spouts as he takes a closer look at the rooms designated for special forces.

They finally reached a free room designated for deploying targets into the place of operation. The style, proportions, everything was eerily similar to the room that was inside of the Core.

Rila tilted her head towards Ferdinand, "Don't think of this as anything extra, the BORING procedures are still all the same around here just like at home."

"I see that." Ferdinand quickly responded.

"I need you *two* to listen." Auto stood in front of the empty shells, "This mission may require *multiple* attempts. We are not here to *exterminate*, nor *assist*, we are here to find a way into the *Bastions' CORE*. We must hijack one of their *machines* in order to do so, and we must *plan* on the *battlefield*. *The Bastion* are an *unpredictable* force."

"Sounds easy enough for me!" Rila exclaimed as she already fit herself inside of a shell with her slender body, "They work in big numbers, I know."

Ferdinand stood and looked at himself, the descriptions of the Bastion kind of intimidated him, but he looked back at his left arm which was a golden tool of war.

A week after Rila's sudden disappearance, Auto and Ferdinand grew closer to one another. The mysteries of the chunky arm intrigued Ferdinand a lot. The talk was always so loud around it, but he never got to see the true potential until this day and the coming month. Both of them stood on the rocky terrain of the Holy Earth's barren wasteland.

"The *time* has finally come, I finally get to show you this *thingamajig* I spent *my* whole nights on!" Auto excitedly buzzed out, "By this time the *gauntlet* should be *perfectly* adapted to your body."

"This better be worth it because it's been nothing but a huge inconvenience this whole time." Ferdinand sighed.

Auto stared at Ferdinand for a long second before getting back into the deal, "What you have been wielding is the *gauntlet*, an *ultimate* machination of an *angel*'s power. This *gauntlet* is perfectly connected to your whole *body*, especially the *mind*, which should let you *materialize* anything into the world. It could be considered a *wish granter* by common speech, but it is not anywhere close to that. Raise your hand into the sky, imagine an *object*."

Ferdinand took a moment to take in such grand information, he reached for the sky with his golden arm and closed his eyes, thinking of an object to grab. A sudden bright flash emitted just above his palm, and it looked like Ferdinand took something into his hand.

"Did it *work*?! What did you *create*?!" Auto's wide eyes could not wait anymore seconds.

Ferdinand lowered his arm, he grabbed the freshly made hot dog with thin lines of mustard and ketchup, "My favorite."

"*THOSE?!*" Auto could not believe, "An *odd* choice for sure, but it appears to be so *masterfully* crafted. What a splendid result, my first attempt would've been a *small steel cube*!"

"Hot dogs haven't been a thing in this world for over a thousand years, thank god for the gauntlet for granting my wish of a hot dog from my favorite stand." Ferdinand joyously replied, he took his first bite and it ended in a disaster. The hot dog only looked nice from the outside, but from its shell the entire inside was filled with dust.

"*Right.*" Auto looked at him disappointed, "I should not have expected you to know the exact *formula* and the *atomic structure* of a *hot dog*."

Ferdinand choked and coughed out the dust that caught his throat. "What is going on here?!"

"That is the angel's power." Auto spoke, "The ability to create anything by knowledge and detail."

"How exactly would I use this in combat?" He asked.

"That *imagination* that goes on in your head, can be *applied* to your *body* as well." Auto talked, "But we must start *small and slow*, I would not want to see you turn into *dust* in front of me."

"So like, if I wanted to fly I could?! Smash boulders in half?! Teleport anywhere?!" Ferdinand was baffled.

"Yes, you must *figure and sort-*" And Ferdinand immediately tried to make use of it, but in a flash he paralyzed his own body, groaning in pain beneath Auto.

Back to the present day, before Ferdinand entered the shell, he took this whole moment to remember what he was taught by Auto. With a deep breath, he entered his shell and so the operation has begun.
