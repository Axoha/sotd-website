Stella, the commander has been detained. 
Rila walked in and sat at her reserved seat dressed formally, another conference meeting has been held by all the six directors.
The intruder, AUTO, stood still at the center of the dark room, ready to be judged.
A parasite who had lived in the walls of the Holy Earth for around a year, watching, recording, living, for no purpose. During the sudden intrusion of AUTO disrupting the command center the mission had become a failure, at the fault of the commander too. An intense exchange of nasty looks has been served, until the machine put its guns down for one request, to work with the Holy Earth. Normally, this request would be dismissed, and the machine would be executed on the spot, however it has rigged itself on a chain that upon death would leak everything about this organization, operation, and script. We could not risk that.

"...Your *script* sucks, it has already failed *THREE* times before. Let us not make it a *FOURTH*, especially not with a valuable *FERDINAND*."  Its buzzing voice echoed throughout the darkness, the Directors listening with an arrogance.

"You have no permit to speak. You will be shut, a machination shall never have its hand over our Holy Earth." The fifth Director, Om, spoke.

"*Foolish*, need I remind you of the *PLACE* I come from? We're a *RACE*, who are bound to find this *sacred* place and *demolish* it. Shut me away *FOREVER* and you will watch the *Holy Earth* collapse."

"I assure you, if there ever was a threat to our ground it would be exterminated immediately." The third Director, Diriel, yelled.

"Let it be judged by the seventh." The first Director, Xavier, continued, "Only then we will decide."

"The seventh?" The fourth Director, Itarima, questioned.

Director Xavier only put down his staff for his response, "He has been waking up."

Deep underground the Resistance hijacked sectors, their true purpose here would finally be revealed. The rebels screamed and yelled, splashing up drinks for what seemed to be excitement for an upcoming show. Loud music boomed throughout the space, bets have been made, and the bloody ring at the center was served.

A punk dressed extreme frantically climbed up a pillar with a bell in his hands, "WHOOOOO IS REAAAAADYYY???!!!" The crowd only went crazy, the floors of the underground shaking with anticipation. Rows have been cleared among the audience for the contenders to walk through, "ANOTHER SO CALLED 'HERO' FROM A UNIQUE SPECIES, AGAINST OUR FLAMIN' HOT MERCENARY HOT ROOOOOOD!!!!" 

Hano walked through the crowd, bruised up with a determined furious face. To his opposite the  mercenary walked through, with a mask of metal and steel fists of fire. They have both crossed the wired fence to the ring, and stood, waiting for the bell to sound.
Ferdinand, chained and held in a prison cell, stood and watched the match initiate from afar. The bell has rung with an echoing boom and the two contenders immediately went up against each other, fists up with mean stares. Hot Rod instantly scored a gut punch, leaving a burn mark on Hano's stomach, but in return he suddenly stroke Hot Rod's chin with a powerful uppercut, which had bruised his fist only more. They traded devastating blows, and the bell has rung once more marking the end of the first round. Despite all the injury Hano managed to stand and survive the round, Hot Rod barely scathed.
Ferdinand watched and thought, everything was starting to make somewhat sense. The rebels aren't here for any sort of control, they are here to toy with Holy Earth's hero rank. Abducting them during missions and putting them against their beloved fighters, a spit in the face of our Holy Earth.
The second round has begun with yet another boom from the bell, the crowd went wild again. Hot Rod evaded Hano's first strike and forcefully kicked him on the chest, tackling him against the wires of the ring. Hot Rod continued his tense execution, pushing Hano into the corner throwing powerful strikes one after another. Hano interrupted his series with a striking uppercut, one that left the crowd silent. A moment, Hot Rod grasped upon his face and he was bleeding. Hano began to apprehend, but as he threw his first punch Hot Rod grabbed him by his arm and slowly, in excruciating pain tore it off. He would not tolerate such insult, and so in the last ten seconds of the second round Hot Rod knocked Hano off the ring, tearing his other arm off and leaving him to bleed out in the arena. He raised his fists up and the crowd screamed and cheered.

"WITH A BRUTAL EXECUTION THIS CONCLUDES OUR NIIIIIIIIINTH DUEEEEEEEEEEL." The punk began to yell again as the bell rung. "FRIENDS, LET US NOT FORGET THE REAL DEAL TONIGHT."

In an instant, Ferdinand was forced out of his prison cell by heavily armored guards. He was bound to become another victim of the next match.

"ABANDONED, WASTED FOR ANOTHER PRECURSOR."

Ferdinand was getting dragged along the entrance to the arena by the guards, his disobedience not letting up.

"A FALLEN HERO, A BELOVED MERCENARY."

Ferdinand was finally thrown into the ring, he quickly stood up and physically prepared himself for what's to come, only to look at his contender with disbelief. He walked towards the ring, wrapping his fists with bandages. He was a clone ready to beat the life out of his own, an exact variation of Ferdinand. A white maine-coon with paint marks all over him.

"DORIAN FIFTY-SIX." 

The crowd yelled and cheered again, chanting his name. Dorian entered the ring and looked down upon him. "I've set this up just for us, Ferdinand."

In a moment of stares, Ferdinand looked. "What are you supposed to be."

He placed his hand on Ferdinand's shoulder.  "I am your predecessor. We share the same story, but I was ditched by the very people I trusted the most." 

The bell has rung. Before he could even react Dorian gave him a crushing blow to his stomach, at a speed that was not ordinary for a regular. Ferdinand immediately started to cough up blood, and set his guard up with his arms. 

"The precursor that is supposed to best me." He walked around the ring, he suddenly sped up once more and kicked Ferdinand right in the head. "Pathetic, is it not?"

He began to slightly bleed from his mouth and nose, still having his guard up awaiting Dorian's next strike.

"At first, I was scared. Suddenly cut-off from a mission, without a light in sight." In a blink of an eye he blitzed for another punch, "But after some time, maybe it was for the better."

Dorian kept on at his slow rampage bullying Ferdinand. After only barely scathing him, he decided to target his more weaker areas. Setting himself up on the wires of the ring as Ferdinand stood with his guard up. He propelled himself from the wires for another powerful strike, continuing his random spouts, "You're a fool, Ferdin-"

Before he could even land the punch, Ferdinand managed to catch him by his throat, slamming him on the floor shortly after. "Will you just shut up, man?!"

Dorian got up in an instant, slightly groaning in pain, "I seen that one coming."

Ferdinand was about to time even more of his punches, but the bell has already rung. Both of them were sent to each corner of the ring, Dorian sat at his box and looked at him, smiling as he was getting prepared for the next round. Ferdinand tried to clean his bloody face using his hands, arguably making a bigger mess. The bell has suddenly rung again, it was time for round two.

"Maybe you truly are worthy." Dorian dashed right into Ferdinand again, starting off with yet another powerful gut punch that has only slightly flinched Ferdinand. He kept his guard up as Dorian kept throwing his best punches, trying to break through his defense to finally execute him. In an instant however, the crowd was left silent again as Ferdinand threw a brutal uppercut in an instant as retaliation. He began to strike with even more moves, this time Dorian kept evading. 

"No wonder I was abandoned."

He stepped back and managed to land a critical hit back at Ferdinand. The crowd began to root for Dorian after their silence, everyone had expected an execution, instead they're getting a real fight. The bell rung, and rung again to signal the third round. Both contenders have traded powerful blows, their same bodies but different mutations have been put into a real test. Dorian had no time to spout his speeches anymore, he had to be serious, his emotion and fiery spark to continue fighting for the Resistance has overwhelmed him, and he made the mistake of falling right into Ferdinand's punches. He looked down to his chest to see that he has been pierced by his fist, a hole through his body. Without a word he collapsed onto the floor, and Ferdinand stood there with his bloody arms. The crowd went silent, nobody had expected this outcome.

The announcer punk had ringed the bell, "The winner as we all saw is Ferdinand."

--

At the underground of the core, Ferdinand's sudden disappearance has been furiously scrambled through every network and file. No one had a clue where he had gone, there has been only evidence of him being alive. Rila walked through the rooms again in a serious mood, to consult with the seventh director deep in the lowest floor, in the darkest space, a throne for the eternal man. There was not much of a talk. Rila was only given an incantation which she must perform within the coming three days. Contrary to belief, everything that had happened was supposed to happen, the script was never truly changed. The seventh only goes by its own script, its own rule, which no one can know until the time is right.
