Their phones rang out with an immediate order flashing across the screen. Ferdinand hardly woke up with barely opened eyes as he stared at his phone screen. The smell of freshly cooked omelets motivated him to stand up, dress up, and walk out of the bedroom to check out the breakfast. It was the same meal that was served to him during the day of the first mission, he thought a little but then got right into eating. Rila served herself a plate of omelets too and sat across him, looking before eating.

"Ferdinand, you really need a better morning routine." She chewed and swallowed.

"Really?" Speaking with his mouth full, he observed Rila who looked more clean than ever, "What do you do during mornings?"

"I wake up at four in the morning, take a shower, dry up, start cooking breakfast for both of us, start to dress up, put on makeup, take care of my skin..."

Bla bla bla, that's all what Ferdinand was hearing from her. He was focused on eating, slightly listening to Rila's blabbering about her very important morning routine. He took the moment to appreciate this current moment, living in a new spacious room with all the necessities, a beautiful girl that was willing to take care of him, and the honor to work for the Holy Earth.

"Are you even listening to me?" She looked at him with an offended look.

He looked back at her in an instant, "Yeo."

She smirked, "Yeo..."

After finishing their breakfast both of them got up to dress up for the job, wearing only the most comfortable attire they had. They walked out of their assigned room and stepped into the hallway, coincidentally meeting with Wall and Hano. Morning greetings were shared, Hano and Ferdinand dapped each other, and everyone walked together in a synchronized rhythm to the armory. As everyone was suiting up for their next operation Rila began her briefing for the upcoming mission.

"Listen up, the first mission was confirmed to be just practice. A mere defenseless resistance camp that needed cleansing. This time it will only be us raiding an encampment located under a disconnected city square." She walked around the room just like before, everyone listened with might and their breaths smooth. "Your equipment will be updated depending on the coming performance. We will be facing foes with random quirks."

"Yes Captain!" They all shouted with unison.

All armored, they walked once more through the glistening interior of the underground. As they waited in the elevator, they enjoyed the view of the busy main hall through the glass door thinking about their coming actions with determination. Marching through the hallways, they finally reached the artillery systems room. Rila took a quick glance at Hano and Ferdinand, who were both inspecting his shiny new shield and other equipment. She ordered bigger deployment shells to which everyone could finally comfortably fit in. Each laid down on the interiors' cushions, optimized their space, put on their seatbelts, and anticipated the launch. The shells completed their event of launch, and as they blasted into the sky, workers looked at the smoke trails outside while saluting.

Back at the control room under the Core all personnel monitored their screens with caution. It was bright, computer beeps echoed across the room, the Commander stood at the middle of the room with patience and a stoic expression.

Footsteps came closer to her, and soon after she felt a huge hand encompass her shoulder. "I better not see Ferdinand go AWOL again." The third Director, Diriel, spoke once more.

She turned head to the Director with a smug expression, "I would not worry sir, I strongly believe Rila prepared him well."

He looked at her, then back at the huge screen to the front of the room that recorded the main operation activity. "So be it."

--

The main squad have landed right at the middle of the city square. It was dead silent, only the rustling of leaves and the wind flew by their ears. Ferdinand got out of his shell last, and he was relieved to not stand in front of gunfire taking bullets again.

He couldn't resist to ask, "What happened over here?"

"Emergency lockdown." Rila turned to him, "Any civilian who has been outside have been taken and investigated, however, those inside the buildings are shut-off until we cleanse this place up."

"That's fearful." He wondered as he readied his shield. "All those windows, doors, is every room just a bunker?"

"Yes." She nodded, "Heavily monitored and secure, be thankful you don't have the job of extracting and investigating each person one by one once the lockdown's over."

The squad continued to scout the dead area, and finally, an entrance to the underground would be found. It was hidden quite well, but also not. Wall slid through the tight entrance with ease as the others struggled, to the point of Rila having to pull Ferdinand through the entrance, and Ferdinand having to pull Hano the same way.

It was very dark, accompanied by a few red dots dimly lighting the long hallway. The doors were open, with a lot of rooms and tight vent holes

"From now on here, as for the Commander's word none of you must move until it's all clear." With a halting sign from her hand, "She'll tell you when to move, I will defuse any traps laying here."

And without a transition she was gone, sliding away in a crammed vent. The rest of the squad stood there awkwardly in silence with the light of the sky shining right above them. The red dots vanished, and so they received an order from the commander to move. Ferdinand moved first covering the front with the shield, as for the others they walked slowly with their weapons ready. They took a turn to another hallway, and a tow hook was launched again. This time Ferdinand crouched in a flash and angled his shield in a way the hook would ricochet off into a wall. Rila jumped out of a vent next to the rebel instigator and slashed them without a second to waste. Ferdinand stood up and signaled to Rila that they were just fine.

--

"Impressive, their performance so far seems to be spectacular."

"It is only the beginning, sir."

--

**24/10/5718, 8:54**

The squad have planted a few detonatable explosives to clear a way into the next designated room, a room which is scouted to be highly crowded and contains vital information to the resistance's plans. Ferdinand held the remote in his hands and offered a game to Hano.

"Rock paper scissors?" He cheerfully signaled.

Hano just looked at Ferdinand's hands, "What is that."

Ferdinand looked at him a little disappointed. Suddenly, the remote slipped through his hands into Rilas'. There was no time for little games.

They backed off a far distance, Ferdinand and Hano stood close to each other covered by the shield. Hano readied his minigun, and the explosion set off with a loud boom. Both of them walked right into the smoke safely covered by the shield with the minigun sticking just perfectly outside to shoot.

--

"This is where it actually begins."

--

**24/10/5718, 8:59**

They slowly kept on walking as the smoke cleared, the minigun firing rapidly mowing down any rebel in sight. Unexpectedly, they had another tow hook cannon readied in the spacious room, and once fired it had successfully penetrated Ferdinand's shield. The rebel pulled the hook, desperately trying to disarm him of the shield, but Ferdinand kept his ground and stood valiantly holding to his shield for life. Wall came right into Hano's hands and was thrown directly to the cannon, successfully disarming and murdering the rebel behind it. The constant gunfire rang in Ferdinand's head, they backed away as the minigun started to overheat. Ferdinand was the last to reach proper cover, and without time to think a mutated rebel extended his hand and tentacles morphed out which instantly encompassed his shield. Ferdinand pulled out his emergency pistol and fired at the attacker, but without luck, before he knew it he was disarmed of his shield. Another rebel took an extreme high caliber gun into their hands and shot directly at him. With incredibly mind numbing sounds, only gunshots and silence followed. 

First shot shattered his shoulder.
Second shot knocked him out, directly to the chest.
Third shot broke his right leg.
Fourth shot missed.
Fifth shot ruptured his stomach.

He fell over to the ground, knocked and frozen from the shock. The dark red blood only flowed throughout his body.

"What do you mean by 'I can't get up'? Pathetic."

Little Ferdinand hopelessly laid on the sand of a playground. He got himself into a school fight, stuck in an audience, a ring of kids.

"I hate all of you."

The kids only laughed. They mocked him, kicking him until he stood up again. His nose began to bleed tremendously, his shirt was torn, and bruises were everywhere. He tried to get into a stance and get a real punch against his bully, but he was punched right in the face again. He laid on the sand again with the kids cheering. There were tears in his eyes, and they flowed freely throughout his face.

"I will kill all of you."

And he stood again with a glare, he leapt at his bully with sharp claws, and he tore him.

**

--

"FERDINAND! RETREAT! FALL BACK!" The Commander yelled, as everyone else were silent.

Director Diriel placed his hand yet again onto her shoulder, "It is no use, take note of the first day Stella, we're about to see something spectacular."

--

**24/10/5718, 9:05**

Ferdinand stood up, despite the injuries and his bleeding state, he stood like a corpse staring down the resistance. They looked back at him with fear, and opened fire once more.

*"...I will kill all of you."*

Bullets were ineffective, Ferdinand rushed despite his broken femur and leapt onto a rebel. He tore him to pieces with his claws, crushed him with whatever he had, his helmet fell over to the side as he mauling the rebel to pieces. Soon after he'd rush after another, and another, they were running but he wanted them dead.

**

"...your child has almost killed his classmate ma'am. There is nothing to argue about, that student has lost an eye, his fingers. He must be transferred to a psychiatric hospital."

Little Ferdinand sat at a chair next to his mom, who was desperately trying to ease his situation. He only stared blankly at papers, silently.

**

The room was clear, it was disgustingly bloody. Ferdinand violently started to gush out blood from his mouth, he began to faint as he struggled to maintain balance. Rila rushed to him and held him in her hands, eventually carrying him out like on the first day.

Later that day he woke up in a hospital. His injuries were properly taken care off, yet he felt stuck to the bed. He felt no pain and wanted to sleep more, but with a sudden intrusion Rila came to his hospital room and laid directly next to him on the bed.

"...Rila? What are you doing here..?" Barely able to gather his word.

"You've done an amazing job out there..." She nuzzled closer to him. "You've made us all proud."

Ferdinand stared without a reaction, but eventually thought and felt a sense of relief. "Thank you."

"You mind if I stay over this night?"

"...Nah."

"Thank you, Ferdi."
