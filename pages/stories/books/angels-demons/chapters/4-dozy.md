After a quick nap and waking up at noon, both Ferdinand and Rila would do their morning routines like as if it were a fresh day. In their claustrophobic apartment that barely had everything they needed, they still managed to separate their spaces and live comfortably together.

"So how do you like it around here?"

"It's okay, not exactly what I dreamt of really. That career choice still bothers me, I was hoping I would be able to create and study things."

"I feel like the higher order will fulfill your wishes someday, you have talent."

"Thanks..."

"You know, about the sixth thing I didn't mention..."

"Huh? What's up?"

Rila smiled to herself.

"My favorite series just got sequel releasing today. I've been hyped for it for the past few weeks, and I want you to watch it with me today."

"Oh..?"

"'CHRISTFORARMS II', yes, that's actually the name. It's about this young adult who's broke and makes a deal with angels to hunt down demons at their request for survival, it's pretty rad, very gory, I think you'd like it."

"Jeez..." Ferdinand breaks his eye contact with her for a split second, caught up in thoughts. He doesn't like brutal movies, but at the same time he can't bring himself to just reject her.

"What? You don't like it?" Rila tilts her head while looking respectfully.

"N-no! I think it sounds really... um... badass!" With frequent stutters, he spouts whatever was racing his mind.

"Sick! It'll be the first part of today's program, can't wait to spend this day with you."

"...Program?"

And in a blink of an eye, he found himself on the passenger seat next to Rila in her car. She looked a lot different, as if she were in a disguise of some sort.

"Today's gonna be a long and fun day Ferdi, you'll get to see more of our Holy Earth."

She'd reach for the gear stick and step on the pedal, their journey would begin slowly as they'd come out of the garage. As they drove, Ferdinand would look out the window at the towering golden skyscrapers barely touching clouds. Fascinating, he'd glance at the diverse groups of people on the streets. Lots of aliens, humans, sometimes even his own kind. Everyone wore something fancy like a highly ranked prestigious knight. The buildings looked a lot to the style of his home New York, old timey and fancy iconic visage with lots of light and soul.

"Is it normal to go to the theatre in the morning here?"

"Of course, movies sell the best when they premiere so soon. Everyone's gotta work and be busy in the afternoon, though, some enjoy going to the cinemas at night for that romantic and cozy feeling."

"Oh okay, got it. I also wanted to ask what's up with your appearance? I'm not saying you look ugly or something, I like that ponytail."

They would share a silent awkward exchange with their eyes.

"I used to be a celebrity here for a short time during my early days, I wrote songs and performed them live at concerts. That was however cut short after I lost my eye. I hated the new look, but it does make me look very different."

"You know, I thought someone would have to be insane to wear a haircut like you do. I mean, I heard that it's bad for your eye? I-" He'd stop talking as he noticed that Rila was giving her a mean and confused look. "My apologies."

It was a bit silent in the car shortly after that.

"You probably never seen 'CHRISTFORARMS I', but it's pretty much like this. Takes place in a world terrorized by demons after humanity has tramped with their hell, in a society oppressed by powerful deities. Once there is a guy bullied by demons who have thrown beans of curse at him, and eventually he has enough of that so he climbs the tallest skyscraper in his city after making a meal out of those beans to establish contact with angels. That meal made out of beans would turn their curses into blessings, and so when the boy would climb high enough to reach clouds, he'd hold the meal with both of his hands as high as he can. Angels would descend after thousands of years, and a deal would be made. The boy got crazy powers which would tear across him, golden crosses would emerge from his wrists and forehead. His whole body, mutated. The boy would receive tasks from angels to slaughter and eat demons with his new sharp shiny crosses. OH, I forgot to mention he had a best friend since childhood, but they've grown apart in the movie. That best friend turns out to be a demon with the name 'GUNSFORARMS', an embodiment of the rising gun violence problem. That movie proceeds to end with with the boy defeating his best friend, and he would not execute him, but would become best friends once more."

"Uh." Ferdinand would stare blankly at all that information, it's definitely nothing he knew before, something like a whole new genre for him. "That's kind of crazy."

"I know right? I used to read the comics before watching the movies, but the movies change a lot. They cut out a bunch of things, kind of a bummer."

"You seem really passionate about that franchise..."

"Yup, we're here if you haven't noticed."

Baffled at first, Ferdinand would look out the window to the sight of the grand theatre. Looking like something straight out of his home but fancier and more modern, flashing lights with signs of text saying what movies were premiering at the moment. A flashy red carpet would lead to the main hallway at the entrance, with posters and ticket stores on the walls accompanying the entrance. "CHRISTANDGUN, REVENGE OF THE HELL DEMON"; A brutal poster showing off the movie they were about to watch. Ferdinand would look at himself thinking if he wasn't dressed properly for this despite his clothing now being provided by the government.

Rila would spot the buffet, "What snacks do you want?"

"I'll take the nachos with melted cheese."

"No salsa?"

"I don't like spicy stuff, no thanks."

"No salsa..."

After buying their favorite snacks and checking in their tickets, they sat down at the theatre room coded with "F72-O" all the way at the back. Being so close to speakers would disturb Ferdinand, as he knew there would be loud sounds, but Rila only watched at the blank screen with a wide smile that translates to anticipation.
A dramatic waving Holy Earth's flag would appear on the screen, text would slowly fade in as the lights dim. Everyone stood up, and a robotic voice would repeat the text on the screen.

"...MANDATORY EXERCISE, CLEANSE YOUR MIND AND BLESS OUR HOLY EARTH. NO SPEECH, NO DISOBEDIENCE, SALUTE AND LISTEN~"

Rila would gently hold Ferdinand's arm and get him to stand up as the Holy Earth's anthem would start to play. Left hand to the back, right arm to the ceiling. The theatre would be silent and only the soothing music of the anthem would echo throughout the room. Finally, after 6 minutes the anthem was over and everyone sat back on their seats. "Sorry, I forgot to mention we do this for places like these." Rila would speak to him. Ferdinand trying to get his right arm comfortable after having it stay up for a longer duration would oddly positively respond, "No ads though!"
The lights turned off and the movie would soon start playing. The nachos, hot and crispy, would almost kill Ferdinand as how good they were. Rila brought in spiced nuts and a bag of popcorn, both of them would silently share their snacks to one another.

"IN A DISTANT FUTURE, CROSS AND GUN, PROTECTORS OF EARTH..."

They both watched in anticipation.

"THEY MADE AN OATH, TO CLEANSE THE WORLD OF EVIL." *Blood curdling screams echo*

"GUN, help me with this DEMON!"

"HOYOYOYO!" *Gun's face would morph into a fully functional minigun, and it would start shooting, turning that demon into blood dust*

The movie's intro sequence would play out with the duo killing demons harassing the city, Rila's facial expression hasn't changed, but Ferdinand was already feeling terribly sick. Some time would quickly pass by.

"...The worst demon of them all has been awaked once more, CHRIST and GUN, it is now your top priority to clean this world of the HELL DEMON." *The grand angel would speak with a thundering voice from the skies*

"Affirmative, ANGEL." *They would both say in unison*

Ferdinand would look over to Rila again, this time she was slouched more to the screen. Some more time would pass by.

"YOU FOOLS, THE HELL DEMON DOESN'T EXIST, YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING A FALSE GOD." *Screams of a probably important character would pierce their ears* "THE ANGELS ARE MACHINATIONS OF DEMONS, PLOTTING TO TAKE OVER EARTH WITH LIGHT."

The audience would gasp. Ferdinand would've been mostly fine with the movie by now as he would discover the meta of just covering his eyes during the insanely grotesque scenes, and Rila was completely invested in whatever was going on the screen. Their snacks and drinks eaten and drank, even more time would pass by.

*CHRIST and GUN would walk together in a barren wasteland, strong winds howling and blood everywhere*

"This truly was a crucifying experience wasn't it?"

"I'll miss this world, with humanity gone and the demons eradicated, I guess we are the only ones alive."

"That ancient figure did tell us if only one is alive, GOD will come and new life will begin."

"THE STAKES ARE HIGH, LET'S BRAWL!"

"I'LL KILL YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!"

*The movie would end with a bloodthirsty fight, whoever survived would be left with the audience's interpretation. Credits would roll with emo rock music playing*

"That was so cool." She'd say to herself in awe, without noticing that Ferdinand ate all her snacks while she was focused on the movie the whole time. "I guess it was pretty cool." He'd respond, his sickness from the movie averted by the taste of nachos and melted cheese.
Both of them would enter the car once more. They would talk to each other about the movie, Rila constantly talking while Ferdinand awkwardly tries his best to reply back in someway. It was like a blur, still only at the afternoon of the day. 

"I want to show you the garden." Suddenly switching topics.

"The garden?" Ferdinand would ask as he tilts his head.

"A garden, you may know them as parks or something like that. I'm pretty sure New York city has a big garden at its heart."

"Interesting." He responds, deciding rather not to spoil something for himself.

The car would stop, and through the window he'd see a huge plot of land with many patterns grown out of shrubbery, trees and colorful flowers. A river flowing streams across the land, breaking it into pieces. A massive wide tree covering the center of the garden, carved on a little island created by the river. All with massive skyscrapers towering over the edges of the garden.

"This is where the first celebrations came to be, three thousand years ago. The humanities Angel would leave it's mark on this land, crafting that wonderful tree at the middle."

"It's so much nicer in person rather than in books." In complete awe, as his eyes rest from the golden spires to the restful star shaped massive garden that lied beneath him.

"Haha, I bet."

They'd walk on the cobble paths across the garden together, everything was kept cut and clean. There would be a plentiful of other people at the garden, some with their kids too, which were joyfully playing around in the grasses. Ferdinand would also spot a big greenhouse which he didn't know of before at the garden, though he wasn't really curious about it. Looking around more would strike him with the reality of the harsh and strict system of this place, cameras everywhere and automated guns. Rila noticed the uneasy feeling that was settling in on Ferdinand.

"That security system, don't make a big deal out of it. If you get caught in its fire it won't kill you, I believe it's there to just scare and keep order."

"I still think it's weird, I can't believe I was spied on my whole life and it probably won't stop."

"Honestly that wasn't too literal, I was exposed to only brief information about you back then. I can guarantee you that we did not actually spy the whole time, because we have better and important things to do. There ain't a gun to your head! Cool down a bit."

"I guess so?" Confused.

Both of them would finally find a nice bench underneath the big tree where to sit, covering them from the sunlight outside with it's cool wide leaves. 

Rila would stand, climb up a moderately big rock, and take a really nice red apple from the tree.

"You can do that?!" Ferdinand would be shocked and baffled, but Rila wouldn't say a word. Instead she'd take a bite out of the apple and share it with Ferdinand. "Yes, you can. You're allowed to eat the delicious harvest from any plants here."
Hesitant at first, he'd hold the bitten off apple in his hand debating whether he should or should not taste it, but after Rila gave him a few 'you should eat it' looks, he complied and took a bite. So juicy, so sweet, felt like an entire new world.

"I heard the nicest apples specifically grant knowledge."

"It definitely felt like it did~"

She didn't even have to ask, Ferdinand was absolutely enjoying the taste of that apple. Her curiosity turned into a wide smile once again. After some long time of hanging around at the garden, the sun was starting to set. Both of them would get into the car for the last time today and would drive off back to the streets.

"So how was today?"

"I definitely expected more to it with the direction you were heading, but it was pretty cool."

"How critique, I enjoyed it too."

-- *INTERMISSION* --

**Now playing: "Untitled.mp3" 5718, July 25th**

"What do you think of that fancy new phone?"

"It's so fragile! I should be so much more gentle with it."

"I can imagine, after using just actual bricks this must feel insane."

"IT IS."

*Phone buzzes*

"Did you get that notification?"

"WHAT?!"
"Oh I'm recording oop-"
