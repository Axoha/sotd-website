The Holy Earth, the one string of time where humanity had reached its absolute peak. For millennia it held its position of the mightiest empire among all of existence, controlling the masses from other earths without anyone knowing. For millennia they had chosen subjects in secret to further aid their quest into breaking the impossible, and on the great year of *5720* they were successful. 
The Holy Earth stood still in space, its lush surface long-gone. It was composed of beige rock and gilded cities, a disgusting sight in nature. Green rifts cracked in space and the *Bastion's* long abandoned capital ships hovered closer to the Holy Earth. Months ago, insider information was revealed that the Angels have supposedly attacked the Holy Earth, and without hesitation the Bastion prepared all it had left to take over the cursed place in its moment of weakness. They news did not fool them, the Holy Earth really did not try to defend itself. There were no signs of any weapon systems activating, no signals. The Bastioners took the opportunity and paddled forward with full power, calling in the remaining capital ships that held all of their machinery. Hundreds of thousands ships flew closer to the Holy Earth, their size and amount big enough to block sunlight itself from reaching the planet. The ships marched closer in the eerie silence, until a beam pierced through one ship at the frontline, creating a noticeable flash in the vacuum of space. The forces grew confused, there was no identifiable source, until a bright white light shined on the horde. Levitating in the space, staring down at the incoming threat; Ferdinand, the Angel of War shined with two pairs of massive wings similar to diamonds. With no hesitation the Bastion opened fire, using all of its weaponry for a slim chance to take down the Angel, but deep down they knew it was long over already. The explosions and impacts have not affected Ferdinand whatsoever, he only raised a fist and shined a beam that took down a dozen of capital ships with ease. In another flash he zoomed from one ship to another, piercing through them with the speed of light, tearing what collided with him to shreds. For those ships that tried to escape, he would target the most, nobody was safe. Once the massacre was over, without a sweat and expression he levitated back and looked at the debris that was left, he raised his fist once more to get rid of the mess.

"Oh, you've grown again."

"Have I?"

"Yeah, you age very fast!"

Emilia spoke to Ferd, both of them alone in another apartment building. A wall was covered with notes and marks, studies of the Angel she was taking care of for months by now. Together they lived in secret with false identities as the Holy Earth slowly recovered from damage.

"How fast? Do we knot the answer already?" Ferd asked, tilting his head with curiousity.

"We can assume you age a whole six months in one single month. You were probably five years old when you were fabricated, leaving you to be..." She thought as she talked, looking at the notes. "Twelve years old."

"Twelve? I don't feel that age." Ferd murmured.

"I don't feel my age either sweetie, I'm fifty and I still look and feel like twenty." Emilia responded, jotting down something on the walls once more.

The sun slowly came down as they talked and thought about what to do, their notes were littered with plans, wondering how to prevent the current depressing situation to escalate any further. Once the sun fully came down Ferd asked.

"Mom, will you finally go with me to dad?" He tugged at Emilia's shirt.

"No." She sighed, "I've already gotten over it, you won't persuade me to talk with him ever again."

"Aw." He frowned, "I'll be there for now, if you change your mind." 

And with a flash, he was gone.

Akimi was sat on a log near a campfire, roasting some more of his marshmallows in the mountains behind the Core. Light shined for a moment before fading, the unusual not shocking Akimi anymore. He glanced over at Ferd to notice Emilia still missing.

"She still doesn't want to come, does she?" He started talking.

"No, I feel like every time I bring you up she gets more and more mad." Ferd sat on a log next to him, leaning down holding his chin with hands.

"That's natural." He replied, "Maybe I should get over it, too."

Ferd looked at him and thought. Akimi reached out into his bag of marshmallows and offered him a stick and a piece, which he gladly took. "Any news? How's the research going?" He asked.

"It's going ok, we still have no clue what to do." Ferd sighed, "It turns out I probably age six months in one, making me twelve years old by now."

"That's a big number!" Akimi exclaimed, pleasantly surprised by the age, "I better not be the one to teach you about what's to come!"

"Don't say that." Ferd replied as he glanced over while hovering his marshmallow above the fire.

"I'm just kidding! You know, just trying to fill in the silence with some joy."

It turned a bit silent after.

"I just really want you and Emilia to be together." Ferd murmured.

"I know." Akimi replied.

"Not even just because it would be very nice, it's because that may be the key to stopping all of this! You could finally work together, I could get you another gauntlet, we could-" He stopped talking as his voice suddenly cracked.

Akimi covered his mouth, cackling trying not to make a noise but he failed to contain the reaction and let out a strong laugh. Ferd slowly turned to him, his expression swiftly turning into a disappointed frown.

"Look, I'm sorry but-" Akimi tried his best to calm the situation.

"No wonder mom doesn't want to get back with you." He crossed his arms and turned his head away from him.

"Y'know, you may be onto something." He shrugged it off and began to chew on his roasted marshmallow.

Together they shared the rest of the night simply talking about various subjects, wasting time they couldn't during the day. After hours have passed, Ferd, as always would return to his home and snuggle back into bed next to sleeping Emilia. There was comfort in the dark times, a hardly considered freedom.
However, they didn't know that the next day would change everything again.
News flashed across all the screens, a revolutionary invention took the world by storm. Huge crowds of people were gathered around the podium of the Core, where previous concerts have been usually held. The six directors were surprisingly outside, the whole time they have been hiding away in the underground shadows. One of them raised their microphone and spoke live to the camera, an astounding demonstration was bound to be performed.

"Bless your morning as we dive deeper into what's coming for the people in this world, an invention that will forever change how we are protected and how the military will function."

A capital ship warped into the sky above the Core, immediately deploying what seemed to be a shell into the podium. With a loud impact, smoke obscuring the next great thing, mechanical whirrs were heard. Once the smoke has cleared an exosuit was revealed, brushing off the dust with a personality that seemed odd to the population, it's single eye looking around the environment.

"These are SPEARs, organic machines designed by each Director. Being triple the size of a regular human or mutant, these machines can perform tasks at an unbound efficiency."

The Spear demonstrated its technology and weaponry it has been equipped with.

"But you may wonder, are machines not sinful against our holy code? You may fear not, as each SPEAR is piloted by a single person inside."

The exosuit opened it's chassis, revealing a friendly pilot waving with a smile. The audience cheered and clapped.

"The original HERO rank will be reformed, the Holy Earth will become much more secure. Millions of these machines have been already produced and carefully tested for release, with billions more on the way. Bless our maker for granting us such technology, the technology that will end all wars today."

And with that the major part of the presentation was over, oddly fast. The Spear closed its chassis with the pilot inside and flew up back into the skies to its capital ship. The audience cheered again and went silent as more showcases were imminent.
Ferdinand returned to the Core after wandering through the cosmos for some time, apparent that the Seventh called him for something important. Ever since the murder of the Angel and his ascension he's been mostly let free, but he continued to serve the Holy Earth because he had nothing left anymore. He walked to the throne room, curious for answers that the Seventh may hold.

"*Ferdinand, my boy. Have you seen the news?*" His voice echoed amidst the darkness.

"I have, master, tell me about the next step of the script." Ferdinand replied, kneeling down.

"*End all the wars.*" With an intimidating tone, "*Traverse the cosmos, destroy every conflict, cause Holy Earth to be the only one remaining. I will prepare the next step of the new script.*"

Ferdinand looked down with a determined look, and in a moment he vanished. There wasn't a need for more answers, as he already knew what to do.
In one corner of existence stood an empire known as Nexus, with an unnatural force that has been deemed a threat for ages. It was a world eager for control, using godlike beings known as "Prodigies" to ascend their goals of dominance further. Their cities were defined by black buildings with red tints, striking fear to the hearts of anyone who opposed. An army was gathered in front of a portal, ready to strike and raid for conquest, but it has been calmly interrupted by a shining light in the sky with a silhouette of a figure that slowly descended down. His wings extruded from the back casting a shadow upon the army, raising his golden arm with unmatched might. The people of Nexus, confused, in their nature responded violently and opened fire, which hasn't affected him at all. Ferdinand locked his eyes onto an assumed leader of the army and dashed in a swift blink, firmly grabbing their throat popping their head. The blood stained his body, but it wasn't his concern. He swiftly zoomed from place to place piercing through buildings leaving behind explosions that littered the world with smoke, he raised his arm and disintegrated even the innocent lives with just a thought. His eyes were long due of a soul, there was only anger in his expression. He continued the slaughter until he was finally confronted by the long lost prodigies, who did not even try speaking to a monster. Their bodies were immune to Ferdinand's simple tricks, forcing him to resort to physical violence. Prodigies were capable of many powers unique to each member, one could control matter, the other light, some even the minds, they were generally seen as the secret super-beings of the universe.
But even then, they were no match for the Angel. After crushing their bodies and leaving the earth in ruins, he vanished with a flash to execute other empires to end all wars. He pierced through the planet's cores, one after another. The Resistance, Otherworld, Star Tek, Legion, he slowly took out each force that held even a smudge of chance against the Holy Earth. He looked at the fires before vanishing back into the cosmos for another target.
But he heard a voice in his mind, something wicked was rapidly approaching him. A plane of existence shattered like glass on his right and a beast leapt right at him with malice. It was a skinny creature barely resembling of a human anymore, fitted with cybernetic modifications and indestructible long tentacles extruding from his back. It's weaponry dug deep into Ferdinand's golden gauntlet, the beast somehow giving itself a moment to have a fair fight with the Angel.

"THAT GAUNTLET, IT IS *BEAUTIFUL*." It screeched out with a raspy voice, somehow communicating in the vacuum of space.

Ferdinand was not up for a talk, he mustered up strength and punched the beast directly into its face, knocking it off the gauntlet. He quickly regained his sense and dashed to execute the beast.

"DON'T EVEN TRY." It screeched out with a raspy voice, somehow communicating in the vacuum of space. Ferdinand was confused, he mustered up strength and punched the beast directly into its face, knocking it off the gauntlet.

"...What?" Ferdinand looked around instead of attacking, he sensed that it has just happened, and it dawned on him that the beast in front of him can control time.

"I APPLAUD YOUR ENDEAVORS, WHO COULD *YOU* BE? YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR, NOT *BEAUTIFUL*." Both of them flew in the cosmos, staring down at each other conversing from a long distance.

Ferdinand didn't respond, he only continued to angrily stare as the dried blood on his face gradually cracked and drifted away in small pieces. 

"*ADAM*, REMEMBER THAT NAME." It backed further away, "YOU HAVE MY RESPECT, I HOPE TO NEVER SEE YOU EVER AGAIN."

But even then, they were no match for the Angel. After crushing their bodies and leaving the earth in ruins, he vanished with a flash to execute other empires to end all wars. He pierced through the planet's cores, one after another. The Resistance, Otherworld, Star Tek, Legion, he slowly took out each force that held even a smudge of chance against the Holy Earth. He looked at the fires before vanishing back into the cosmos for another target. Ferdinand called in capital ships loaded with Spears to aid him with the destruction, continuing the rampage planet after planet. Without a competition, or civilization, war would not exist.

"Mom! Look at the news! Right now!" Ferd exclaimed in the noon, tugging at the bed sheets waking up Emilia who was comfortably snoozing.

She groaned, she was tired, but the news have bewildered her. It was an unusual system to place so late in the Holy Earth's age, getting rid of the Hero rank was a huge deal, and it was obvious that this whole system was not for good intention. Both of them looked through their windows down onto the streets, noticing a Spear already walking through acting like strict security. It held a massive fabricated gun in its hands, which raised the question of the Holy Earth caring for property damage. They had to be focus on being safe more, those things would totally pulverize them, or at least Emilia if they were caught. 
After some more observation they heard knocks on the door, which they shouldn't be hearing at all. Something terrible was imminent. Emilia grabbed Ferd and hid behind their bed. Mechanical footsteps muffled behind the doors, and the door was gently opened. A machine walked by, noticeably similar - but tiny compared to the main Spears. Emilia hid in the shadows to prepare a silent take down, but the machine sensed her before she realized. There was no way a human was in control of this thing, the Spear extended it's weaponry and used a laser cannon on one of its arms to blast her. She carefully evaded the shot, the blast leaving a hole in the wall scattering their notes across the entire room. Emilia morphed her hand into a sharp dagger of dark matter and pierced the Spears' head. The machine was knocked, surprised, it had no alarms or self-destruction sequence up its sleeve, it was really that frail. Ferd came out from hiding and stood next to Emilia, both examining the scraps of what remained. The machine resembled a bunny, coated with dark black steel laced with copper wire. They wondered what this could've possibly been for.

Alarms have sounded at the Core.
The walls of the underground were being destroyed by the Spears, both the small and big variations in hordes. They were not being controlled by humans, or anyone in that matter. The Spears menacingly stomped by with their mechanical legs, slaughtering anyone who they see. Their destination was tracked, they were slowly making their way towards the Directors. The employees and remaining Hero ranks tried their best to halt their march, without success. The Spears were frail but came in swarms, their scraps littering the floor among the corpses. There were six Directors hidden at the council room, and they awaited the moment for one Spear to finally burst the doors open. They were very well aware on who was behind all this. A single Spear lodged its hands through the metal gates and tore them open, staring down at the Directors.

"O' Glorious Seventh, your pathetic treason has us all disappointed." One of the Directors spoke, their voice echoing like thunder.

"*You don't seem to understand, have you been expecting to play the higher role forever?*" A voice came from the Spear, "*You were destined to die, all of you. It was always a part of the script. Your fates are sealed.*"

"Your flawed ideals end here, your script has failed countless times before. We, six sacred demons, will live on to prosper forever. May god not be merciful towards your wretched soul."

The Directors readied themselves, the demons in the shadows lurking. The Spear however remained still. "*You don't seem to understand, I am not your executioner.*"

A light came crashing down into the council room, landing at the center. Ferdinand stood up with an angry look, observing his surroundings. The Spear deactivated itself, leaving Ferdinand in a room of six Directors for a clear purpose.

// // // //

"*Have you killed them all?*" The Seventh spoke to Ferdinand personally.

"I have." He coldly replied, his fur was dark red.

"*I am proud of you, you have ended all the wars. Nothing remains anymore, leaving space for the next step.*" He reached his hand of wire to pat Ferdinand's back.

"You're all that I have left, thank you." Ferdinand stared at the horizon, his eyes and expression were empty. He only mumbled, the remnants of his crushed soul trying to speak.
