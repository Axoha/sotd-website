Before Ferdinand dropped on the roof, Rila managed to catch up to him as the train came to a stop and held his faint body in her arms. She signaled with her hand that he's alive and the extraction team can come forth to pick up the bodies. She had no other choice to but to come with them as well, what else was there to do out in the heart of a massive city?
Hero enlistment rates have soared to limits no one could imagine, the Resistance have cowered back in fear and left the Holy Earth for good, their main icon was dead. Ferdinand has become a symbol for the Holy Earth after the brawl, the people cheered and yelled for him during the broadcast across the whole world, their hearts beating as one. He laid on his hospital bed without the ability to move, he was fully wrapped with bandages and tubes inserting various fluids into him, but it didn't really matter to him, he was content because of the fight. Rila came into his hospital room and leaned over him, Ferdinand only being to move his eye and mouth slightly around.

Rila smiled widely, "Meet me after your surgery." She had her hand on his bandages, caressing his cheek with her other.

Ferdinand tried to say something back, but all that came out were ragged breaths. Rila walked out of the room and he looked back at the white ceiling. He may have been content, but it was also very boring out here.

Operation Seven-Twenty.
A plot to force Ferdinand into ascension.
He must be weakened, hurt, to force his body to adapt with the matter.
It had finally come to its closure.

A proposed gauntlet design, a whole golden prosthetic the twice of Ferdinand's left arm was bound to be attached to him, fueled by the blood of the captured six angels powering the Holy Earth. Ferdinand was taken into a dark room, Auto and the Seventh Director looming over his body and beginning the advanced surgery. Re-attaching each single nerve with atomic precision, entangling the wires of the prosthetic perfectly to his body. Piece after piece, the gauntlet's several parts were being carefully attached together. There was a stone embedded at the center of the hand, five-hundred grams of light matter safely contained within. The second the gauntlet has been fully attached with Ferdinand's body, the veins of his form pulsed with a white glow. All of his other injuries rapidly healed before the sight of Auto and the Seventh's. They have done it, the first angelic weapon ever created during the entirety of humankind.
He would wake up in his room the following morning, the chunkiness of his new prosthetic immediately fascinating him. He has never felt so alive before, he got off the bed with complete ease, and walked to the kitchen following the smell of breakfast getting ready. He bumped into multiple furniture with the prosthetic along his way, leaving bumps and scratch marks on some places. Rila looked at him and chuckled, serving omelets again for both of them.

"You know, I really thought you'd wake up right after the operation was complete." She talked as she munched on the food.

"I was tired." Ferdinand spoke while struggling to use his fork with the left prosthetic, "Couldn't they have proposed a slimmer design?"

"Save that question for later." She continued eating greedily, "We're both more similar now, Ferdi."

"I'm safe back at home, but I can't help but ask, where's the commander, Hano, and Wall? I haven't seen them in forever around." He asked with concern.

"What a curious morning for you." She put down her fork and knife, "Always asking questions just be patient dear, we haven't even gotten to your real reward."

She stood up and began to lean over to him across the table, "Singlehandedly fending off the whole rebel force, killing their main symbol and motive on a broadcast, and improving our economy by a tremendous amount deserves some sort of reward don't you think?"

"I- I guess so?!" Rila was getting very close to him, he blushed and nervously backed. She put her finger on his lip. Without a second to think Rila began to smooch him so passionately, she tangled her tongue around his, she held his head with her hands and Ferdinand's resistance slowly gave away. She pulled his head away with saliva bridging their mouths. Ferdinand was very red, his blood rushing through his veins. Rila was not done yet however, she took off her shirt and sat  right across him wearing just her bra and baggy pants. Ferdinand was visibly shaking, Rila touched her nose with his and looked him into the eyes. No words have been exchanged, Ferdinand reached his right arm to cup her breast, and she grinned widely. He could not believe any of this was happening, he was under total shock, the woman he loved so much just letting him use her body in such ways. Ferdinand always wanted to tell Rila how he feels about her dating all the way back to their first training, but it seemed like she knew, as if she could read his mind. It was their shared massage, Rila started deeply smooching Ferdinand again until her phone vibrated with a special request. She had to get off of him, putting her shirt back on and returning to her usual business. Their breakfast was left on the table unfinished, and he was still frozen in shock, it had felt so good, too good.

"Well, I have to go now, catch ya later." And with that, Rila walked to the door and left.

Ferdinand looked back at the food on the table, until suddenly he heard the doors open again, "One more thing, why don't you meet with your new companion? There's nothing special happening today."

He just nodded, deciding to dress up properly and walking into the long hallways of the underground. He walked until he bumped into him, who turned around and immediately jumped with excitement.

"*FERDINAND*, my *name* is *AUTO*, such a pleasure to finally meet you *in-person*!!!" He extended his long hand out for Ferdinand to shake.

"Who are you supposed to be?" He scratched the back of his head, with looks confused.

"I am an *alien* from the far reaches of space. I have been assisting you from the *shadows*, I have *designed* that shiny *GAUNTLET*, I really look forward to *finally* working with you!" He excitedly yapped about whatever he had running on his mind.

Ferdinand looked at him again with silence, later finally shaking his hand. "Sure, I have a lot of questions to ask."

"*SPLENDID*, I can be your *walking encyclopedia* as we *hangout*."

Rila's expression shifted into a more serious one as she walked the hallways. She was requested to meet with the Directors in-person at the control center. She opened the doors and saw all of them stand formally, the Seventh stood in the middle. It was a massive dark being made of wire with a screen for a head, fully awakened. All the Directors looked in unison towards Rila as she walked further, she stopped when she was a fair distance from the Seventh Director.

"A lot awaits us." It's voice echoed throughout the room. "A discovery has been made. Timeline Twenty-A variation Sixty-Six, that is the cat's origin point correct?"

"Almighty, yes." Rila replied.

"Laura Ray, you remember that individual, correct?"

"Almighty, yes."

"She has been finally tracked and found."

That sentence has struck Rila deep into her heart, but she was not willing to refuse. The Directors gave her orders and she immediately set off, there was only one more piece left and it was her mission. She dressed into her suit used for missions, took the medication required to travel through timelines, and boarded a private train to appear in that timeline. The journey took her a week but there was nothing to waste anymore, she continued walking, boarding a car back into Ferdinand's New York. 
It was a snowy night, the city was lit up with the red, green, and blue lights all across. Decorated Christmas trees stood, the kids were playing around in the snow, the taxi's were honking constantly, Rila snuck past the people with her black suit in the darkness, infiltrating Laura's apartment building with a success. No one was in, she took the elevator and walked off at her floor, she slowly walked up to Laura's door.

Knock knock.
