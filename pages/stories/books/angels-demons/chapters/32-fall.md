"Hi." Gabriel walked up to Ferdinand, "Would you be down to chat?"

Ferdinand looked at him with confusion, "No."

"What a shame." He smugly replied, "Too bad I was ordered to talk with you."

"What do you mean by that?" Ferdinand was slowly getting a little irritated.

Gabriel pulled out his phone and showed him the order from the Holy Earth's highest command, the Directors themselves. "This, exactly."

Ferdinand sighed, "Sure, let's get that over with then."

"Perfect." Gabriel smiled, "Show me around the Holy Earth, I'm new around here."

They slowly began to walk throughout the streets. To Ferdinand's surprise, people were absent, the streets were unusually silent. Gabriel asked about various details, like the stores, the people, the history, it was never enough. They were headed to one of the gardens, arguably the most interesting place they could've gone to at the moment. They sat on a bench under the cover of the huge tree, the leaves providing a cool shadow for them to bask in as the sun set. Ferdinand, wanting something to quench his taste, reached up to grab an apple to eat. Gabriel was silent, but he stared in horror and disgust as he would just casually do such a thing. Ferdinand offered, but he rejected, saying he does not like apples. They took a subway back into the heart of the city, the interior of the train reminding Ferdinand of the events that unfolded a long time ago. Gabriel continued to talk, squeezing him of all information possible.

"You are much more friendlier than I expected you to be." He suddenly spoke amidst a moment of silence. "I think I'm starting to get a full picture of the whole situation."

Ferdinand brushed those words off by his ears, not really paying attention to him. They boarded off the subway, Gabriel immediately suggested going to a rooftop of a skyscraper. Ferdinand was confused, but agreed. They walked a high set of stairs, rode various elevators, just to finally reach the strong winds that awaited them. It was apparently Gabriel's favorite spot, a spot where you could see the entire city with a breath of fresh air.

"Ferdinand..." He spoke, facing the city while standing on a ledge that separated him from death. "Everything that we see will be gone once the time here reaches midnight."

He was bewildered, "What do you mean by that?" He frantically asked.

"You have been found by Angels." He replied, "And they are not happy."

Such response sent Ferdinand in a slight trance, he could hear his own slow heartbeat. He thought, looked back, and remembered. Guardian Angels were supposed to arrive, the beings who killed his father, and he was destined to stop them. Constantly being told from the Directors to prepare, he could not believe it was bound to happen so soon. The sun hid behind the horizon, and the winds continued to howl with suspense.

"You have gone through so much pain, you have been forgiven by me." Gabriel continued a speech, "Initially, you were supposed to die, but you are seen innocent from my eye."

Ferdinand, shocked, "What are you talking about?!" He slightly yelled out.

"I suppose I owe an explanation." He held his palm to his chest, "I'm not Gabriel, I never worked for the Holy Earth. I am Angelo."

Ferdinand felt betrayed, he began to feel his heartbeat too.

Angelo reached a hand out to Ferdinand, "Hold my hand, let's get you out of here, be free of your chain."

"Liar." Ferdinand coldly stared, "Everyone I meet deceives me."

He tilted his head awaiting more from his speech, but in a sudden turn of events Ferdinand threw a fist directly aimed to his face. Angelo prevented the hit by holding the gauntlet with his hand, his eyes widened with a slight gasp.

"Angel's power outmatch false ones tremendously, stop this." He replied, "I don't want to kill you."

But Ferdinand was stubborn, he attempted to swing and hit more, each without success.

"You have to let go of the Holy Earth's lies." Angelo spoke as he countered each of his attempts, "You have been given a chance at redemption from heavens, do not reject it."

Ferdinand's moves became more desperate and looser, "How do I know you're not deceiving to me again?!"

He evaded more of his strikes, "What remains for you here? Would you really rather suffer more for mindless orders?"

Ferdinand tripped and fell onto the ground, struggling to get up, overwhelmed by emotion. "My whole life I was only a mindless puppet." He stopped fighting.

Angelo walked up to him and crouched down, "I'm giving you an opportunity to be free, you are worthy of my salvation."

Ferdinand rubbed his eyes, and remained still, sitting on the ground leaned against a ledge defeated. "Nothing remains for me here anymore, I am lost." Expressionless.

Angelo reached his hand out once more, "Please." He requested, "Take my hand, end your suffering, it pains me to see you like this."

He looked at his hand. In a long moment of silence he accepted it, despite hesitant, he slowly reached his hand to hold it.
But he was suddenly chained, the strings of matter snapping onto his arm dragging it into a portal. He was instantly flung into the deep depths of the abyss, a voice like thunder echoed.

"*FERDINAND, FOOLISH!*" A voice spoke to him as he flew in the void, "*FIRST YOU FAIL TO TERMINATE RILA, NOW YOU ACCEPT DEATH FROM THE VERY ANGEL THAT MURDERED YOUR FATHER!*"

He frantically looked around, panicked. A chain struck him by his right eye, another chain penetrated his chest, his original heart. He was being torn by forces he couldn't comprehend fast enough. He tried to dislodge the chains that were stuck within him, but without luck, he squirmed, he shouted in pain for no one to hear.

"*YOUR HEART IS NOW MINE, FERDINAND. DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME MORE.*"

**02/7/5719, 23:50**

. . . . Controls cut, attempting to fix . . . .

. . . . Systems cut, attempting to fix . . . .

. . . . Unable to fix, requiring manual input . . . .

. . . . Unidentified entities sighted, power dislodged, running on reserves . . . .

. . . . Unidentified entities breached Angel's Chamber . . . .

The workers inside of the Core, in absolute panic, frantically pressed all the buttons and options to prevent this coming catastrophe. Alarms have sounded everywhere, the Angels have destroyed the systems of the Core in seconds. Lockdowns were a weak futile attempt, the Angels walked by the hallways and the doors opened for them.
There were seven of them, they descended down the long underground shafts into the deep chamber where the Seventh resided. The unknown throne room of the maze he had long build, the Seventh must be terminated immediately. The Angels surround him, who calmly sat on his throne.

"*I have long awaited this day.*" He spoke, but the Angels were not here for a chat. They raised their hands and fabricated weaponry while growing a pair of four wings. The Seventh, in return ordered a swarm of Demons, similar to what Rila was upon them.
Angelo was secluded from the rest of the Angels, he was getting ready to begin the reconstruction event. At the top of the skyscraper, despite his grief, raised his hands and began to form a shell. He flew up above the clouds for space, once the round sphere was complete the six prismatic legs were formed. Another Guardian Angel was born. It walked through the city, uncaring for any destruction directly for the Core. Amidst the sudden chaos, Emilia grabbed Ferd by his little hand and ran outside to see. He was right, the end of the world was to happen this very moment. They ran more for a better, clearer view, unintentionally bumping into Auto along the way.

"*Rila?!*" He buzzed in an exclamation.

"Auto?!" She yelped in confusion.

"WHO IS *THAT?!*" He pointed directly at little Ferd.

He waved awkwardly at Auto, "That's my son..?" Emilia tried to make sense of it.

"*No time for it*, I sense he is an *Angel*, we ***must find Ferdinand!***"

"Hold on to me." Ferd suddenly exclaimed, "I will get us closer."

Emilia quickly placed her hand on his shoulder, and she signaled with her eyes for Auto to do the same. He was hesitant, but he did swiftly place his palm on his shoulder. Ferd then grabbed both of their hands and in a flash they appeared at the wastelands not too far from the grand Core. The Guardian Angel walked, each step caused the entire city's lights to flicker. The six directors were in charge of stopping the chaos, calling in their capital ships from which shells containing soldiers of the hero rank dropped in. The Core's - No weapon system on the Holy Earth was working, the capital ships were their only hope of subduing the Angel's plan. The ships fired everything they had, their massive orbital strikes, bombardment, the smoke often obscured the sight of the Guardian Angel.

"There's nothing we can do, is there?" Emilia talked as she sat on the rock ground, mesmerized by the action that was going on before them.
Ferd was silent, he had mixed feelings on what was going on, he was not ready.
Auto looked, unknowing of what to think. It could hardly be believed that the end of existence was already happening.

Once the Guardian Angel found it's spot, right next to the Core. It raised two of it's prismatic limbs into the sky, emitting a long flash similar to a star.
Suddenly, one of the cannons of the Core started moving. It aimed directly at the Guardian's shell, and fired once.

. . . . Jet-Powered XL Shell 'Model-85' ready for impact . . . .

. . . . Impact successful . . . .

Awaiting next step . . . .

A shell, of unusual size was lodged deep into the Guardian Angel. Out of it came Ferdinand, who swiftly hung and climbed to the side as the Angel was focused on generating the beacon. Speculative, he may have briefly restarted the systems using his gauntlet to operate the cannon. He grabbed the skin of the shell and tore it off with his golden arm, tearing deeper through the flesh and blood. Full of aggression and hate, he eventually reached the massive hollow inside of the shell. Angelo floated in the middle, connected to various huge nerves that linked his body with the outer shell. He opened his eyes and looked to his left, where he saw Ferdinand with a cold dead stare. He lunged upon him with his golden arm, Angelo frantically freed his arms from the nerves in a reflex to somehow stop Ferdinand, but his reaction was faster. Ferdinand grabbed his face and crushed his head, the shell stopped functioning and all the body parts fell into the ground causing a massive impact. Ferdinand continued to tear at Angelo, never enough of the violence. He tore off his limbs, and his heart, breathing heavily full of adrenaline. The shell split in half, exposing the action to the outside world. The capital ships have stopped firing, instead they began to broadcast. Ferdinand extruded four massive wings from his back, he yelled in pain as he was covered in blood, a bright light encompassed his head. It was clear, his ascension was complete.
Auto, Emilia, Ferd, all looked bewildered, there was no sentence that could describe what just happened.
