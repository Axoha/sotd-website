A week has passed, and the Holy Earth had changed forever since that day. The Angels have ultimately failed once more, despite causing a lot of damage the Holy Earth managed to get back on its feet swiftly.
Akimi, who lived in the scorched wastelands for decades, cursed by immortality, brought a notebook to his hand and began to write. The recent events bewildered him, without a warning nor message the world could've ended right there. He wrote with an old pen, his handwriting tiny to conserve as much space possible within the pages. 

"Are you my father?" A quiet voice came by his right side.

Akimi slowly turned his head towards the voice, it was Ferd, the big-eyed cat of white fur and red marks. He only stared with wide-eyes in shock as Ferd patiently looked back at him.

"Both of us have seen each other for a glimpse in the past, have we not?" He quietly talked, "I immediately felt a deep connection, even stronger than to what was supposed to be my father."

"Who are you?" He stopped writing and asked.

"I am Ferd." He tilted his head and smiled, "The son of Emilia."

"*Oh my god.*" He dropped his notebook, the memories came back, it all began to make sense. He was frozen, Ferd slowly walked closer to him and tugged with his hands, Akimi kneeled down and hugged him. "Is she alright? What has happened?" He asked.

"I will tell you everything." Ferd murmured.
