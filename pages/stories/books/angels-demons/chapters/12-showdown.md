One punch after the other, Ferdinand continues to trade devastating blows against Steel-Fist. The crowd watched with amusement, his sixth match yet he never broke a sweat. He tore the armor off of Steel-Fist and dug his claws deep into his skin, proceeding to tear the skin off him, concluding as yet another win for Ferdinand. Despite still fighting for his honor of Holy Earth, the crowd cheered for him, only the bare few have survived for so long in the ring. Some looked with confusion, he did not look tired at all, nor stressed, he didn't look like he felt anything. Four of the last seven contenders he went against were abducted heroes, but he did not seem to care, he only stared at the digital poster of an upcoming Holy Earth concert with his bloodstained face - The final return of the majestic musical artist Rila.
Everyone was hard at work at the Core fabricating and designing. Rila walked guarded by knights across the facilities and rooms the employers doing their job through windows. The artillery cannons of the Core were getting loaded with powerful shells each that could level an entire street. She lit up a cigarette and smoked after dressing into her new outfit specifically designed for this event, two days have already passed since the awakening of the Seventh Director. Its awakening was expected for way later, but with the sudden intrusion of AUTO and the abduction of Ferdinand, an opportunity has opened up and immediate changes have been made. Operation Seven-Twenty was finally nearing its completion, and everyone could not wait any longer. Rila walked up to the top floor of the Core and looked at the glistening golden city, she dropped her burnt cigarette butt and stepped on it, the black ashes leaving a mark on the clean shiny floor.

"Yo, Champ, brief me on the news. Everyone here is eager for updates!"

"You got it Boss, I can't lie the news recently always get me on the edge too. I don't think I can really hold much of a rad energy regarding these."

"We lost a lot of good people, I understand."

"Rebel friends, that heartless monster Ferdinand is still alive. We have collectively decided to 'retire' him from the ring, however, we received a final request regarding him from an honored brawler."

"Him?! Isn't he retired?! Across the universe at some random wild planet?!"

"He was, but Ferdinand's sudden uprising in this current tournament has sparked something in him. He requested for the tournament to be cancelled, instead to be replaced with his one last fight against Ferdinand."

The news from the speakers continued to roll as he walked down the hallway with the rebels cheering with hearts full of uncontrollable excitement. Antimov was a beast, a scarred human that had his legs, hands, and head cut by the strings of the Holy Earth. He never gave up, his will to live inspired his rebel friends to continue fighting for a better future, his backup always fabricating mechanical prosthetics for each limb and organ that was sliced. Before the fight he asked for a private chat with Ferdinand, and the rebels guided him to his prison. Ferdinand sat there in the darkness only the dim light from the lamps illuminating the cell, contained in chains tightly wrapped around his arms and legs. Antimov sat at the other side, clasped his mechanical hands together and tilted his head slightly down. He was a giant, a head taller than Ferdinand. He proceeded to start talking in his low, robotic and buzzing voice from his mechanical head made of refined metal.

"You must've been treated very well with the higher ranks. Living the good life after escaping a tough uninteresting reality."

Ferdinand looked at him in silence with sharp eyes, but he ultimately slightly laid back and responded.

"I have to put up with this woman that smells too much like vanilla."

"You have been destroying yourself Ferdinand, a piece of your soul gone after another. I had always wanted to ask after I heard, what compels you to fight?"

"It's for that lady. She loves me, she praises me, she treats me right. I always wish to come back to her so she can be proud of who I truly am."

"I see."

Antimov stood up and walked off, but before he left the cell, he turned his head back to him.

"Dorian suffered through the same story."

The sun stood at the center of the day, thousands of people were clumped up together awaiting the grand event that was bound to happen at the front of the Core. Employers rushed, hastily setting up the basic necessities. Rila watched through the window at the people, reminiscing of her time long ago. The finale was about to begin.
Antimov walked into the ring, each step along the way inducing a loud mechanical thud. Ferdinand was unchained. His body, still covered in the dry dark blood of his enemies, only shook him before the mighty Antimov. The rebels were not cheering this time, instead they watched with strong anticipation. The bell rung and both contenders immediately walked upon each other, Antimov immediately charging up his fist and landing a perfect strike on Ferdinand's head. He was knocked out in an instant. Antimov refused to go for an execution and so the crowd stood up and began a countdown. On the eight second, Ferdinand managed to put his fists down on the floor and push himself to stand up. With a broken snout and a bleeding mouth, he had a lot of words to say but his mind was not working quite right. Antimov on the other side was glad to see him up, and looked down on him to start throwing even more devastating punches. Ferdinand guarded his head, desperately trying to block and evade his coming barrage. Every punch slowly fracturing the bones of his wrists, he caught an opportunity to evade a blow and strike back. Ferdinand predicted his coming right hook and stroke back with a gut punch, only for Antimov to just stand still as if he was hit by nothing.

"Not bad."

Antimov immediately gripped Ferdinand's shoulder and charged his right fist about to completely break his face, lucky for him however the bell has rung and the first round was over. Ferdinand dozily walked back to his corner, wiping the blood off of his face using his fur. A kind fan was generous enough to give him a wet towel and bandages to prepare for the next rounds, as this was gonna be a war. The bandages would help Ferdinand keep his arms and legs stable and in-form, broken bones would not matter. Antimov tended to his life support attached to his back with the help of many rebels. The underground was finally about to witness a brutal and fair fight. The bell echoed again and the second round has started. Throwing punches, kicking, clawing, Ferdinand somehow endured yet another series of continuous attacks from Antimov. He suffered through broken bones already with the bandages keeping him up, his punches grew more loose, but even after giving his best the mighty titan still looked like as if nothing had damaged him. The third round begun, and later the fourth, where Ferdinand was hit, stumbling across the ring finally fainting down.

"Hey... mom."

"What's wrong Ferdi? How was your first day at the boxing club?"

"It's nothing, don't worry about it."

"Naw, I see that bothered look on your face, I'm here right for you."

"I was kicked out."

"Really?! Why?!"

"I do not fit in, like everywhere else all the time. I beat and fought well like how we trained together, but I am too strong and big and they have no one else like me."

"I'll have to get that sorted out with the principal right away, I can't believe they would seriously kick you out for such stupid reason. You're so talented at boxing too! Ugh..."

"Its ok mom."

...

"Did you at least break your bullies' nose?"

"...yes, I did."

"Haha! That's my boy! With that natural strength you could protect me at night when you grow up."

Ferdinand heard the faint countdown coming down to another closure, and with his endless anger and determination he got up again. He needed to win this match not only for himself, but everyone he cares for. Antimov stood at his corner, amazed by what his body is capable of. The fourth round has come to an end, but in a blink the fifth would begin, the last round where it had to come to an end. The bell sounded, both of them got off their seat and slowly walked up to each other, until the underground has come to an immediate lockdown with intense alarms blaring all across the space.

*"POR EL PODER DE LA SÉPTIMA, UN CONTRATO CON LOS 惡魔, MANIFIESTO EN LOS CIELOS DE ESTE DÍA CON GUERRA Y DESTRUCCIÓN."* She held her hand to her eyepatch, and her left eye began to emanate a white light.

Rila began her walk on the stage, the population of the Holy Earth screamed in joy as their eyes laid upon the most beloved celebrity they have met for a short time return. She grabbed the microphone stand as the Core's cannons slowly raised into position.
She begun to sing her incantation, the unrecognizable words disguised as real words sheathed behind a melody. The synths of the melody rose up as she sang, and the main beat has finally come into play. The cannons started firing in-sync with the drums of the melody, slowly one after another. Rila slid her feet across the floor spelling out invisible symbols, disguised as dance moves. She continued to sing, and once she got to the chorus the artillery shells finally set ablaze the city square that the Resistance hijacked. Her singing and walking dance moves only hyped the population even more, the massive explosions in the distance were like fireworks to the world. Buildings collapsed, smoke rose, despite the assumed horror Rila only sang her hearts out to continue the show, and the population loved it.
Narrowly escaping the underground chaos, Ferdinand evaded the falling rubble as he ran for the nearest exit. The deafening explosions coming from the surface collapsing the entire underground system the Holy Earth had previously established, every rebel ran for their life confused as to what is going on. Strong panic has set in, few specific artillery shells have somehow phased through the surface and exploded at the system's most vital foundations. 
Rila continued to sing and dance for the Holy Earth, the artillery would stop firing whenever the drums were out of the melody. Her eyepatch was lit up like a star among the sky, her dazzling outfit and a miraculous ponytail flaunting on stage. The song was reaching its closure, and it eventually ended with lots of mind-blowing effects. 
Rila's final concert - The Encore was over with a bang.
