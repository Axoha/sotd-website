Soon after his death - Ferdinand returned, as if nothing had ever happened. His body only temporarily being gone after Merdiare's false Supreme Angel transformation. Every plan they had up to this point resulted in failure, the Seventh would take his godhood back soon enough. Ferdinand stared at the giant corpse of Auto, hearing a voice calling to him to finally end everything. The population that resided in the Core dubbed the "New Babylon" slowly evacuated one by one in giant capital ships which warped from surface to the depths of space. Ferdinand made his way into the corpse, the stage was set, the theatre would soon commence.

~ *Scene I - The Confrontation* ~

Adam appeared before Ferdinand once again, his tall and skinny figure looming over the titan.

"Do you realize the consequence of your action?" Oddly, he began to speak fluently. Ferdinand ignored him and proceeded.

"It is clear that deep down you're just a lost soul, so was I long ago." He continued to express himself, vanishing and teleporting next to him as Ferdinand made his way.

"I have whole repetitions after me. I sought pure power and in return I lost everything, consumed by my endless hunger. After the last reconstruction I was left a feeble lurker, a traveler without a purpose. Wrath turned unsatisfactory, a last feeling that died out within me soon enough." Adam continued to speak with his raspy voice, Ferdinand still remained ignorant.

Adam has grown sick, he disabled his golden arm with one of his tentacle hands and forced his head to face him. "*SPEAK TO ME!*"

But Ferdinand's eyes only opened widely, as if he saw the world again for the first time.

"There is nothing I can do break you free from fate's control, is there? Your character has been rewritten, you are no longer who you were." He let go of his arm, rendering him free from his grasp.

"I will await you at the vast end of space, that is if you're not eternally punished by the divine being that awaits." And with that, he vanished.

~ *Scene II - Regret* ~

Ferdinand broke through the shell of the corpse with ease, but it was not long before he was consumed by the void that waited inside. His vision turned blind, and upon reopening his eyes he found himself in a familiar, colorless place. He woke up in his home at the streets of New York, and the bullies that used to torment him stood around his laying body, mocking Ferdinand. His golden arm was gone, he was young. The bullies continued to laugh at his dramatic state, but he has had enough of that already. He grabbed at one of the bullies and tore at him, clawing and severely injuring him at any place. The rest of the group ran away from him, but they couldn't outrun the titan. The pools of blood served as an entrance to the Holy Earth, another world void of color. He was trapped, and his only way out would be to confront all the souls he had fought. Members of the old resistance appeared and did whatever they could to stop Ferdinand in his wrath, no more tow hooks. The color of blood shined red in contrast to the lack of color, one by one he gored the people who even dared to cross his way. Two familiar beings appeared before him, a deformed axolotl and an buff architect-species character, both lacking a face. They did not fight but Ferdinand in a relentless rampage murdered them with bare hands. A demon appeared behind and shot him, seven bullets into the heart. He bled out but his capability of fighting did not change, the demon disappeared and more resistance soldiers appeared. He slowly killed them all, but the madness just wouldn't end. Antimov appeared, brutally beating the life out of him. Even with experience Ferdinand was left scarred and wounded by the aged champion of the resistance. He picked him up by his hair and tore off his left arm, together with his right arm. Ferdinand was tossed away, but the void refused his death. Two golden arms replaced his missing limbs, and without a second thought he immediately leapt at Antimov infused with Angelic power. He was torn like all his victims, and in victory he screamed - he knew it wasn't going to end. The Bastion forces have arrived, the thousands of Bastioners he had slain appeared again, all holding the power of Angelic matter.

~ *Scene III - Remembrance* ~

The ground cracked and shattered beneath him, falling down into another void. He immediately found a surface to latch onto and soon enough he found himself sliding down the Bastion's main pyramid, descending from the light that covered the tip. The Bastion's forces warped around and opened fire, not even caring for any damage and destruction they do to their sacred pyramid. He slid and leapt side to side evading any attacks, the fragments of his two golden arms peeling away as he held himself to the slope. A strike from a Bastioner walker directly hit him - his body flew, both of his legs gone. The void refused his death once more, he was given golden legs. He flew above the forces who watched with a dead look, a comet that reflected against their eyes. Ferdinand created a massive glowing spear in his hands and struck down multiple ships with a single blow, another massacre was bound to begin. The Bastioners cloned and screeched, fabricating themselves into any tool with a slim chance of stopping the titan. The walkers closed in slowly, the Bastion used its entire arsenal. With how many injuries he suffered at once Ferdinand barely looked like himself anymore, layers of meat and bone swiftly regenerated back on an unrecognizable figure. He slowly marched, clearing hordes with power equivalent of a nuclear explosions. Soon there would be nothing left but dust, the world remained monochrome stained in the green blood of the Bastion. The titan stomped onto the floor and it shattered once more, dropping down deeper into the void. A swarm of perfect Bastioners flew by, the final evolution of those who had successfully infused with Angelic matter. Ferdinand's body glowed like a second sun in the darkness, six gills with each testament written on them extruded from the sides of his head. The false Bastioner Angels beckoned in fear, the false god that terrorized the cosmos ages ago has returned. Holding many titles such as the Titan, the Seventh, the False God, it was the one and only Angel of Fate. The perfect Bastioners scrambled their hands, swiftly fabricating a trident to impale themselves with as quickly as they could. Ferdinand grew twice in size, his body remained except for his arms and legs - replaced by golden mechanical limbs. His eyes shined and glowed, a never-ending static washed his mind to proceed through the purgatory. He slowly descended down into the void, into the deeper levels.

~ *Scene IV - Godhood* ~

The Angel of Fate is a fallen Angel, an entity who had once tried to take over the place of God. It had claimed to seen outside of its own vision, it claimed to see a world out of the unbound, but the council only refuted any conspiracy - they were the creators. They were the highest beings in existence, creating and destroying life in a repetition, for a reason best defined as "joy". The Angel of Fate took care of the children of the sacred timelines, controlling the fate a line of variants would experience within their life.

**I**

Everything that exists within begins from a simple cosmic creature with the power to create from its blood in a void of nothing. 
The blood, known as matter, would flourish across the void and form galaxies each different. 
The blood formed life, the first sentience. Angels and Demons as they are called, the light and the darkness. 
Life had gone so far, the creature grew old, eventually dying. The first species had grown in rage and panic, without a task, without a reason, without a god. 
An Angel had stepped, and declared itself as god. The Angel was not like any other. Over a violent execution, the population only obeyed. 
It had chosen an Angel of Life, and the Demon of Death. It declared itself as true Fate, the three pillars of everything that exists, the flow of reality. 
Angels continuously grew in rage, a false prophet, a false God. They merged together and became one, another creature, their unity, the true light. The six testaments only shined ever so brightly, the six gills of the creatures' head. 
The Angel of Life, the Demon of Death, the Prismatic God, together they banished Fate. In an event that had caused immense destruction, existence had been split to seven.

**II**

The Prismatic God created more worlds, stories, and reality. An attempt was made to fix the shattered existence, to unite the seven sacred timelines together once more.
An event was agreed upon, one that would be used only under extreme circumstance. 

*"Reconstruction"*

The Prismatic God would descend down upon the sacred timelines with Angels, who would bring only the children that were free of sin into the unbound - an afterlife and the background of existence. The Prismatic God, in a complicated and incomprehensible move would impale itself, ending all life that was created.
The Angel of Life and the Demon of Death would perform an important ritual, merging their blood with the Prismatic God to revert the measurement of time to nothing.
Only the Prismatic God would remember the events before a reconstruction event happened.

Incomplete, unsatisfactory. The False God remembers past repetitions too. It took in the mask of humanity and lived among people, eventually sabotaging Gods' work to force a reconstruction. It brought wars, famine, disasters whenever it felt to destroy the effort every Angel put into creating an existence. Every repetition was left incomplete, unsatisfactory. 
Once when humanity was left in ruins once more, the council had decided to intervene with the children of the timelines - unknowing that it fed the plot of the False God. The Holy Earth was created, the script was manufactured, the plot to take over the throne of God and reach out of fiction began.

Ferdinand's body was tearing apart, his flesh slowly melting to expose the thick golden mechanical skeleton hiding beneath his chest. He became a giant looming machine, a true successor of the Seventh.

~ *Scene V - The Ending* ~

Auto levitated, curled within a core. Upon sighting the monstrous being that Ferdinand became, he vanished and appeared in front of it. Auto opened his chest with haste and closed his eyes, praying for an instant execution to make his dream come true. The Titan could not speak even if it wanted to, with a slow swing he aimed to crush Auto's core. The golden machine pulsated with power, too much power. His ascension brought him beyond the limit. Something froze the Titan's left arm. He struggled to move, the golden arm was suddenly enveloped in golden chains along his whole body.

"*Ferdinand.*"

One familiar voice spoke to him that he could not forget. His left golden arm shattered into pieces and a glow emanated between him and Auto.

"*Don't do that.*"

The sparkling fragments of the golden arm melted and morphed into Laura, the transparent soul of his mother. She looked up to him, reaching out to hold his right hand.

"*I so knew I should not have just let you wander into that dangerous mess.*" She scoffed, upset at herself. With a swift move she dug her arm deep into his chest, getting ahold and grabbing his soul out of the machine. He was scarred, instant emotion began to sip in at him as he stood there staring at her. She tightly hugged him, taking as much time as he needed.

"*It is not your fault.*" She directly told Ferdinand, having to look up due to his sheer size.

Auto fell onto his knees behind them, "How, *why?*"

She turned to look at him, he was just as devastated as Ferdinand.

"*My soul was trapped in that golden arm, I saw it all happen through his eyes. I'm not letting the reconstruction event happen this way.*" She crouched down as she talked to Auto, "*If I were to not step in, the Seventh would have already completed his plan.*"

"Mother..." Ferdinand finally spoke his first words, "Where were you?"

"*I already said it.*" She turned back to him, "*I can only assume you missed me, your original heart spoke in ways that brought me back. Those feelings you have experienced from time to time, that was always just me trying to communicate."

Ferdinand tried to hold his tears. Laura walked up to him and checked his body, examining her son that she missed, "*You have barely changed, you're still just my titan who needs to control his emotions.*" She smiled.

"What happens now?" Auto asked, uncertain of what could follow.

"*This theatre needs to end.*" She boldly stated. "*The Seventh still lives in the remains of that golden machine... He must be destroyed here and now.*"

A static of electricity cracked in the background, a moment of silence was shared between them all. 

"I'll do it." Ferdinand spoke up, fighting through his emotion after a long minute of thought, "I will be the one to begin the reconstruction."

Both Auto and Laura have turned to him, "*Ferdi...*" She spoke.

"I'm the only one here suitable for this, I can't let Auto suffer more." He talked to her, "I want to do something myself for once, I want to do good."

"*Violating the sacred rule... I fear we won't see each other ever again, not even in the afterlife.*" She turned her head away from him, "*But that's a brave decision that I can't help but be proud of you.*" She smiled.

"Are you sure you have what it takes to beat the Seventh?" Auto asked with a concerning tone.

"The Seventh is a *coward*." He faced Auto, "All this time he had been using everyone else for his goal, he is incapable without anyone to force - he has nothing on a person like me." He turned to the Seventh's ominous core, "I believe I know what I want to be."

Laura and Auto walked up to stand besides him, she held his hand and spoke.

"*I wish I could've spent more time with you.*"

**III - AN ANGEL MUST NOT EVER KILL ANOTHER ANGEL.**

The reconstruction act has begun, a rift had formed just outside of earth. The Prismatic God emerged from the void like a newborn, looming over the corpse of Auto's Supreme Angel. The skies have darkened, the last ship of the remaining population vanished, the world was empty and silent. Thousands of Angels have spread across the sky and cosmos, along with Demons that chanted and clapped. All the stars turned to eyes, looking at the Prismatic God as it performed the ritual. An Angel would be severely punished for breaking such an important testament, no matter the reason. The six sacred angels floated at the front of the Prismatic God and sang with cheer. Light particles were seen landing on several planets, bringing pure life into the unbound. The Prismatic God fabricated a spear and embedded it deeply into what used to be the Holy Earth, millions of crosses have grown from beneath the ground across all the planets known. This was a performance brought without mourning, the Prismatic God was mad. Anger fueled every move, despite the cheerful dancing and celebrations. It was unsure what was coming.
Ferd ran through the chaos that was going on at the surface of earth, unwilling to return to the unbound, unwilling to give up on life. He found an empty flat surface and screamed out at the top of his lungs to the Prismatic God, his tears streaming down from his eyes harshly.

"STOP IT!!! STOP IT NOW!!!"

And indeed, it stopped.

"An Angel? On the surface of a planet like this?" The God spoke in a caring way, they refused to hurt a single Angel, nor ignore. "State your reason, I am listening."

Ferd's throat was sore, he was exhausted from all the running. He fell onto the ground, "Please, listen to me. Let's talk before you end everything!" He tried to stand up, but failed repeatedly.

The Prismatic God came closer to the earth, their long beak observing Ferd. Soon enough it extended a hand, to which Ferd crawled onto. They brought their hand closer to their face, and Ferd found himself face to face with the Prismatic God.

"I observe you are a newborn, where is your predecessor?" They asked with question, the cosmos silent as each Angel and Demon stopped to watch the exchange.

"Cut it." Ferd bravely spoke, "I was born here, the children are innocent and pure! You should be ashamed to even begin this event under the fault of an Angel you failed to banish!" His throat was still sore, but his mind was not.

"Impossible, an Angel cannot be created." They were confused, "Tell me about yourself, if not for a newborn you would have been punished for such act."

"Your ignorance ruins me, every divine being is terrible." He sobbed, "The life you create is beautiful, yet you trash it at any given moment something goes mildly wrong. The beauty resides in imperfection, when will you realize that?!" He yelled, desperate to convince the mind. "If you continue, you will be dead and the Angel of Fate you despise so much will take over, I guess that sounds better than going through a minor inconvenience?!"

"There is nothing wrong with what you are saying, however what do you wish for me to even do in this ruined existence?" The God tilted his head, curious for more.

"If you so incline, go back in time and do not make an appearance. No Angels and Demons, no collider, no divine activity among the children." His breath became more focused, "I beg of you, all those failures were caused by the banished Angel. I promise if you go back to that time again it will come perfect as you always desired. Leave the children, all the living innocent families alone."

"This insight is very important to me, thank you." The Prismatic God nodded, "As you wish, we will revert time of those planets affected by divine activity."

Ferd broke down in tears after hearing those words. "Thank you." He smiled amidst the sudden tears, "Thank you so much."

"Please, don't shed tears." The God leaned closer to Ferd, "That action would however cease the existence of you. Do you wish to stay an Angel, or do you wish to forget all memory and become a child?"

Ferd thought for a long time before looking back up at the God, he smiled as they wiped the tears off of his face.

"I wish to live a normal life."
