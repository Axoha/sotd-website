The next days were spent in grief. No one had a clear grasp of what happened that specific day, Ferdinand's body was gone, the crew were all dead. A proper burial was held for each one of them, Ferd himself was not happy with how the plan turned out, he did not cry as he ran out of tears to shed long ago. A person appeared at the gates of the Core, with torn clothes and an exhausted body. He wielded a gauntlet on his right hand, raising attention and question instantly. He wandered and reached Emilia and Ferd, in a shocking moment a conversation began. Ferd walked up to the traveler, asking Emilia to leave them be for some time.

~ **THE UNION - FIRST PIECE "WHO WE ARE"** ~

"We are the same, are we not? You look exhausted, crushed by torment."

"I am, I am."

"Do you remember me? Do you recall anything from this place?"

"No, tell me what I am."

"Tell me what I am."

"I am Ferd, an Angel fabricated from this world. I am born to love, born to bring peace, born to bring bliss. I assume something must have gone terribly wrong in the future, that I have completely lost myself, that I have forgotten the fate I have chosen in this age. Your memories recall violence, loss, hatred, a similar fate of what created the terror that is Ferdinand."

"I am Ferd, I struggle to live. Every minute I spend fighting against myself, the tease and unquenchable hunger for more ever so consuming my soul. I yearn for love, peace, and bliss. I have lost it all."

"Ferd..."

"I was cursed, brought here for reasons I myself cannot understand. I was sent to purgatory, an age that never existed, an age that I could only recall little bits at the back of my eyes. I witnessed the terror that occurred, the extermination and the great impact. I was always destined to suffer, am I?"

"Hold my hand, let us relive our existence."

~ **THE UNION - SECOND PIECE "UNFORGIVING LIVES"** ~

"We have met a very beautiful girl."

"Don't tell me about it."

"It is an *ENA*, you know that? The working cells of the unbound, an afterlife for pure creation and destruction."

"Her name was Ena, that is all I know."

"There is one particular moment in your teenage year that intrigues me, there is no conclusion to a journey you have taken, it only leaps to the ending making everything not make sense."

"I wish I could tell you, I don't recall anything well myself anymore."

"You are the worst."

"I don't need to hear that from myself."

"Quit that self-loathing already, I am absolutely sick of you."

"I thought it was gonna be me who would gently roast myself above fire."

"We have suffered, we will always suffer, yet despite it all we stand up on our legs and continue on with business! For the greater good! Realize who you are!"

"I may have already realized that, but it is not easy to live like that. I believe I am a regular being entangled within entangled within this... 'god-mess'. A variation of this sacred Ferd we speak of?"

"Uuuurrrrgggghhhh you piss me off to no end, we are one! I am you! You are me! You are not a child of the sacred timelines, we are the child of god himself. Angels, are you even familiar with that term? No you are not! We are born to create, fabricate, bless, go to heaven class or something."

"I thought you'd be way nicer when I first saw you."

"I have a lot of pent up feelings too, okay? You don't have to slowly pour your misfortune on me, I know, I get it."

~ **THE UNION - THIRD PIECE "INCOMPLETE PUZZLE"** ~

"I am so sorry."

"It's okay, I didn't mind it all that much."

"You are not pathetic at all, you are a hero. A completely different person but with the same spirit. You have family, you have honor, your conflicting thoughts of death have just thrown me off terribly, I am sorry."

"There are a lot of holes in my life that I can't recall, do you know anything about them?"

"No, not at all, other than present day. I'm afraid we'll only know once the time comes."

"There is a lot I want to talk to you about."

"Me too."

"I feel like this conversation between us is very important, like there's a lot of weight on us."

"It's because it is!"

"Sorry, sorry."

"You remember the lost pieces of your mind now? We have held hands for a while."

"I believe I do."

~ ~

I have later shared my time here with my mother, who I did not even recognize at first. She comforted me, a touch I haven't felt in years. This world is strange, I have lived an entire life here and I knew nothing of it. I met my father, too, we had roast marshmallows together as we talked about life - I have grown. Ferd inherited my memory, and I his, but together we still didn't know what would happen next. There are holes in my life that only time can call an answer for, it is his fate to fill the life of me. I was uncertain if my presence here was the end of my story, a paradox that would begin the repetition again.

The mysterious traveler quickly became a beloved substitute for the five Ferdinands that used to support the population. Unusual energy readings were reported from the undead body of the supreme Angel Auto - one thing came to mind quickly, Auto was not dead. If he were to actually die, that event would've already summoned the prismatic god and the reconstruction would have begun. After connecting Akimi and Emilia's theory together the Seventh's plan finally became obvious. After his death he would reincarnate in Ferdinand's golden arm, as his second heart was used for the weapon itself. He would take control of his body manipulating his control to reach Auto, who is in the Supreme Angel's core - the heart. Auto will willingly give his life away to Ferdinand, not realizing it has been the Seventh all along and the reconstruction would finally begin. Emilia felt a call, she felt the ideas for the final plan come to fruition.

"Mom?" Ferd slowly walked up to Emilia, "What's happening?"

The wind howled, she stood at the front of the Core's entrance looking at the looming giant that was Auto's corpse, "Did you receive my message, or did you come here looking for me?"

"I've looked for you! You can't just walk away and act weird all of a sudden, I'm scared!" Ferd exclaimed, he felt deeply sad inside, "You have been acting weird recently..."

"Don't be scared." She softly spoke as she brushed his hair with her hand, "It is not easy for me either."

"You're gonna kill Auto, aren't you?" He rested his head on her waist, looking at the Supreme Angel with Emilia.

"I'm the only one who can." She sighed, "If he's truly gone, the Seventh's setup will shatter and existence will continue in peace."

A frown formed on Ferd, "Why does it have to be you?"

Emilia turned, kneeled down onto the ground, facing him. Tears were seen forming in her eyes, "I always wished for a normal life too."

Ferd had no word, he felt the same way she did. Deep down he knew this was their only remaining option. She held his hands as she spoke more, eventually turning into a long hug.

"Besides..." She sniffled and sobbed, barely even speaking anymore, "We will meet again, I'm sure of it."

"Then... why are you so sad?" Ferd felt his own tears flow.

"I don't want to say goodbye, I wanted to live a life taking care of you, away from all the terror for once." She smiled, "But I wish for the people to even have an opportunity for similar dreams."

"Mom..." He looked at her, "You would've been the greatest Angel."

After their long hug was over, Emilia ruffled his hair with love. She smiled, despite the tears leaving a mark on her cheeks. In an odd move she took off the round black sunglasses she wore on her forehead, handing them over to her son.

"I want you to have these, something to always remember me by." She gently gave them to Ferd.

He observed them for a bit before trying it on, eventually putting them on. The world turned monochrome. Emilia positioned the glasses on him to be fit on his forehead just like how she always had them.

"You look perfect!" She giggled.

"I won't ever take these off, I promise." His eyes were big and cute under her iconic glasses.

Emilia tightly hugged him again, "I need to go now, thank you for everything."

And the events after went quickly like a blur. Seeing Emilia walk away until she was gone crushed Ferd, but he knew that it was for good. He took a moment to look at his glasses again.

*"POR EL PODER DE LA SÉPTIMA, UN CONTRATO CON LOS 惡魔, MANIFIESTO EN LOS CIELOS DE ESTE DÍA CON GUERRA Y DESTRUCCIÓN."*

Emilia chanted her cursed old line to recall her power. A bright white light came beneath her eyepatch, and in a moment she turned into the Demon of Desire. She had to make haste, unworldly forces always beckoned upon her whenever she used their power. She fabricated herself a heavy machine gun paired with a backpack that would supply the weapon with ammo, allowing it to fire for long durations. The ammo was laced with dark matter, the only thing that could damage Angels. She leapt into the sky above the clouds, taking in the sight before diving down into the chest of the Supreme Angel's corpse, being just fast enough to shatter through the skin. She dived through the void that was inside of the corpse with a mean determined look on her face. 
The inside acted like a whole separate dimension. The world turned monochrome, she looked for any ground to land on as a being of unexplainable nature began to lurk. A rock appeared below her, she instantly extruded a hook from the palm of her hand to attach herself to it and swing. She landed safely, pulling out her weapon making sure it is ready. In this vast empty space she had to somehow find a way to Auto, the sense of being watched and the rock proving their theory right already. A complex path of buildings slowly fabricated in front of her, a straight glowing gate generated at the end of it.

"*You are not Ferdinand.*"

An echoing voice sounded. Several cracks have formed in the space and from them crawled Autos', dull variations of the cyborg that was once their ally. Emilia immediately loaded her weapon and fire, the bullets grazing and shredding through the hordes with ease. She climbed on walls and made her way to the gate, tearing through the hordes that leapt at her. The Autos' were smart, managing to clone and fabricate whatever they needed, but their power was comparable to a simple Bastioner they had once fought a long time ago. They generated beams, tridents, chains, anything to stop Emilia from reaching the gate, but the bullets were a simple weakness. Autos' of different size came through the rifts, some even huge, more challenging opponents she had to face. Emilia took a risk and leapt for the gate, but one of her legs were entangled with glowing chain and she was pulled away from the goal. She fired, a bullet eventually hitting the chain setting her free. She leapt onto the gate and punched until it shattered, giving her a proper entrance. Nothing lied after the gate, it was a white void this time in contrast to the void she has just been to. It was empty, blinding. Emilia slowly walked through the space until she found Auto, seemingly in his human form, curled up laying on the floor.

"Auto?" She asked, her voiced echoed to infinity.

"You have come to finish me off, dare I ask why?" He spoke, his face was obscured.

"I can't just let you end everything, this way you are contributing to the Seventh's plan. That is not your goal, I know it. " She spoke with a low monotone voice.

"*I have always hated you, deeply.*"

The white void shattered into pieces and the real situation came to be. Auto in his cyborg body rested inside of a glowing sphere that could only be the core, the heart. He communicated with his mind, nerves and wire were embedded to the sphere seemingly built by him to revive the body of the Supreme Angel. Emilia was puzzled by Auto's words, she realized there may not be an option to talk it out. She aimed her weapon and tried to fire, but the gun was jammed somehow. She tried to leap and use her ability but they were slowly diminishing. A chain suddenly struck through her heart, her limbs, her body. An anger resided within her remaining thought, she failed for unknown reason. She watched as Auto's body flew at the center of the core as her body was being mangled by the chains. She tried to speak but no words came out, it was over. Her vision went black.

Giggling and laughter was heard as she saw nothing.

*"Who are you again?"*

*"Not a Demon! Not a Demon!"*

*"How pathetic..."*

*"You can't win! How sad."*

The wind howled, the static noise quickly became irritating. Emilia's torn corpse of her demonic form laid all alone at the mountains. The night sky was beautiful that day, however, but she could not see. Footsteps were heard from her right side alongside the mockery of what could be several Demons.

"Oh..." The footsteps stopped, a familiar voice spoke.

"Akimi." She immediately recognized who it was, "Have you come to make fun of my failure?" Her voice was severely distorted, a sound coming from the core of the body.

"No..?" He was puzzled, "What happened to you?!"

"I do not want to bother with that, get away from me." The voice was getting irritated.

Silence ensued for a moment between the two.

"I always wanted to say sorry." He sat down next to her body.

"What now?" She was still annoyed.

"I overreacted that time, I threw away all that mattered to me that day. I can't forgive myself for what I have done." He sighed, "Especially when I met the Seventh, how he somehow did some time manipulation and used you against me. Seeing how you ended up..."

"I have thought you always hated me since that day." She began to open up.

"It could've been resolved in a much better way, I'm so sorry." He gazed at the Core that shined brightly.

"How are you even still alive?" She asked.

"I'm not." He responded.

"Oh." She replied.

Another moment of silence occurred.

"You don't appear nice looking like this." He suddenly spouted.

"No shit." She went back to her irritated voice, "What are you gonna do about it?"

Akimi held the hand of her body, and in a quick moment she felt her very soul getting pulled back to existence. She was immediately bewildered, checking on her body.

"You'd rather be cursed than be stuck in a corpse, right?" He smiled.

This was the first time Emilia has seen Akimi up close in so long, "You..."

"Me?" He pointed to himself, confused.

Emilia leapt and hugged him without another word, "...I missed you so much."

// // // //

The end of the world was coming, Emilia and Akimi spent their time together looking at the Core, talking about whatever came through their minds. Ferd was absent, both of them had no idea what he was up to, but they believed he was safe. Not long after sitting down on a rock to observe the final moments of existence, they heard footsteps from behind.

Akimi turned his head first, "Oh- there you are!"

It was the traveler, wearing the pair of black glasses on his forehead he was given a long time ago. Both of them made space for him to sit in between. He didn't have much to say, but he smiled.

"So how have you been?" Emilia sparked a conversation.
