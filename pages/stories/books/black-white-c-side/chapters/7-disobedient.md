"...Shit." Lars looked at the massive warship in disbelief, he ran up to the pilot terminal to get going even with their teleportation disabled, but nothing worked. The ships' beam was simply too strong, somehow the Disobedient's outdated technology could still beat theirs.

"Weapon systems online?!" Bill yelled out across the interior, "They're gonna be blown to smithereens in no time!"

"√" Warnie issued that they were, struggling to break through the Disobedient's electromagnetic pulse.

"Call Rose!" Bill ordered, getting the weapons ready.

"[ X ] ‼" Warnie gestured that he was not picking up, and not because of the Disobedient's EMP attack.

"What the hell are the Disobedient doing?!" Houston went through the terminal, figuring out all the ways to get Rose into immediate contact, "This is an act of war! They won't stand against our military at all, what do they want?!"

"They could easily get away with this completely unnoticed!" Lars was clearly stressed out. "Are any other contacts working for y'all?!"

The whole team shook their heads, "No." "Nope." "[ X ]"

"Great." Lars turned back to his terminal.

A mediocre-sized dropship flew out of the main warship, parking nearby for interception. Bill wasted no time for self-defense, he deployed automatic control units and fired right away. The dropship's shield was unfortunately strong enough to withstand even a full barrage, but Bill continued anyway. Once he had to go on for a lengthy reload, two unidentified soldiers in spacesuits were deployed from the dropship.

"Bill you really had to use a whole load on just that?!" Houston yelled across the interior until their chatter was interrupted a breach on the upper side of the hull. Warnie got to action immediately, rushing to protect the major components of the ship. She'd run to the room that was getting breached... only to be thrown out of there tangled up with her extended arms and legs. The rest of the team readied their pistols, shaking in the spot, a hostile encounter with real people was something they never had to do before and something they never trained for. All their operations were meant to be completely secret, hidden from the public. Their stances were completely foiled by a simple EMP grenade tossed by one of the deployed soldiers, disabling all their weaponry and suits. Having disabled pilot suits completely paralyzed them, so much of its weight was alleviated thanks to technology.

"Prepare for trouble..." A snarky, feminine voice sound from beneath one of the soldier's helmets.

"...and make it double!" A snarky, masculine voice came from the other soldier's helmet.

"To protect the world from devastation!" The feminine soldier struck a pose.

"To unite all people within our nation!" The masculine soldier struck a pose right behind her, clumsily.

"To denounce the evils of truth and love!" Her poses were so glamorous.

"To extend our reach to the stars!" And his, not so much.

"Ena!" The feminine soldier took off her helmet, showing off her long messy gray hair that went over one of her eyes. An anthropomorphic panda, trying too hard to strike a fashionable pose.

"Ferd!" And the masculine soldier took of theirs, a white furred cat with black marks.

"Quit it..." Lars grumbled as he was bound to the steel floor of the ship.

"Shut it!-"

Houston's cat, Sweetie, immediately launched at Ena and immediately began clawing her face. She managed to grab it right under its upper legs and held her in front of her face.

"This kitty cat is the most capable out of everyone here, can we keep her?" She looked at Ferd with puppy eyes as the cat constantly hissed and squirmed in her hands.

"Uh..." He looked away, scratching his head.

"Come on! They're all going to die anyway!" She rolled her eyes.

A thrown pistol hit Ferd right in the face, knocking him over to the floor, "Leave her be!!!" Houston groaned as they crawled through the floor under the sheer weight of their suit.

"Isn't it crazy how literally the whole crew fell apart just under us two? All that motto setup, the whole star crusher ship, is the 'bylon this incompetent?" Ena turned to Ferd, completely casual.

"Ow..." Ferd laid on the floor, knocked from the hit.

"What's the deal with y'all, seriously." Lars looked up at them both, "All this nonsense, just finish the job."

"Hey, rat, ya know the Babylon sucks?" Ena spat, "Y'all have a whole teleportation thingamajig we kinda want, y'all could also have a thing that eviscerates anyone you look at. Wish we knew our thing would be so overkill, bleh."

"How do you know about this ship." Bill looked at them with scornful eyes.

"I don't." Ena shrugged, "Not my deal, I'm here for the job."

"Why are we talking to these people." Ferd rubbed his head as he finally got up.

"We took 'em out so fast that it'll look suspicious! They think we're skipping the objective again and strip away our rewards, ugh." She took a roll of tape and began to stick Sweetie onto a wall.

"Fair point." He walked towards the ship's terminals, observing the quality.

Meanwhile, within the star crusher's interior, managers anticipated the capture of the ship. The lack of fire or confrontation left them all surprised. The people within the dropship waited for the duo's response, Ferd and Ena, who have both asked before to go by themselves. They have gone through countless missions before, so there wasn't a doubt of success. High energy readings were detected to be coming from the planet below them, however.

The pilot's suits of team Omega sparked once. Houston noticed first, and silently signaled Lars with simple gestures. The EMP effect was letting go, finally.

"Yeah so, the ship is terribly armed, the crew kinda suck at combat..." Ena was on the comms, speaking directly to her leader.

Lars instantly got up and wrapped his arm around Ferd's neck with a pistol right to his head. "Don't even say another thing."

"Oh yeah?" Ena sassily responded. Houston, who was swiftly sneaking up on her back, was wrapped in her arms with a whole assault rifle to their chin. "Well your ass better not even move!"

"I really can't with you..!" Lars' grip on his pistol tightened, he rubbed it in Ferd's head.

"Huh?" Ena got a call, "Wait, you mean that they want us to go to that goofy planet? Disregard and not get paid for the ship mission? DUDE, those EMP grenades cost a whole fortune!" She let go of Houston and kicked them off of her. "Get me my Ferd we're leaving."

Lars hesitated but he let go of Ferd. He overheard the call, it was legit.

"Really?" Ferd looked at Ena.

"We're not getting paid and I refuse to go to that shithole our job is done, Lips agrees." She was, for some reason, furious.

"Alright then." Ferd clumsily followed in her steps as she put on her helmet.

"'Sorry' about the mess y'all." She said her final word without looking back, "Better hope you never have to see us again."

No one from the team said anything.

"Close one." Lars sighed.

"We need to get out of here RIGHT NOW." Houston safely got their cat off the wall, removing the tapes one by one.

"What could possibly be on that planet that's more interesting than our ship?!" Bill was baffled.

"None of our concern." Lars was ready for this to be over.

The dropship from where the duo came from warped into a different space, away from the main warship.

All seemed at peace.

But something from the golden ship was not meant to find its way to Rose.

Rose spent the whole time analyzing the prophecy in his dark lab, obsessed, manic.

Such failure must be attended to, such mistake must be patched.

A rift appears, a crack within space. Skinny, giant, boney hands suddenly crashed through the ground, pulling the beast's whole body to existence. After its legs stomped upon the stars, and its head was out of the abyss, it let out a guttural roar to warn any living being of its presence.
