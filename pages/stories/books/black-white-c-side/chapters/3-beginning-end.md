Two years later, year 2760.

A grand beast was sighted and reported at the edge of the universe. One never seen before, its roars echo throughout the empty desolate space filled with asteroids. A team, under the name of 'Omega', rushed to their assigned seats in their golden ship to deploy immediately. One mission, contain the beast for research.

"This one seems to be massive." Houston left a comment as they pressed a lot of buttons, whilst also petting their cat, "What are your bets?"

"Lethal, skyscraper sized." Lars laid back on his chair, "No other reason why we're getting called so urgently."

"Hey what if Doc just wants a new specimen really bad?" Houston smiled as they turned the final switch before initiating the teleportation sequence.

"☺☺Ω § ‰ ‼" Warnie, a fellow new crew member excitedly signaled with her hands. She was a stick figure, similar to the ones people use on signs of any kind.

"I'm not expecting too much." And at last, there was Bill. The boss of the crew.

"'Course you aren't." Lars smirked, the engines of their ship trembled the whole cockpit.

Teleportation in five... four... three... two... The ship disappeared from the hangar before the timer hit zero, as always.

And suddenly, it reappeared at its destined location. It was eerily quiet in the asteroid field.

"Hey, safety check!" Lars clapped his hands twice, "Check for health, anomalies, whatever. You know the deal."

"Seems like I'm good." Houston spoke after pressing a button on their chest to check for general health, the program within saw no problems whatsoever.

"Well except for the fact you switched spots with Warnie!" Lars laughed it off, Houston didn't even notice, their seats were almost identical.

"*There goes my streak!*" They winced.

"‼‼‼ :( …" Warnie's hand signals expressed the same thing, probably.

"Asteroid fields always make me feel uneasy..." Bill scratched his chin, "They go by so fast! Any mistake can end us swiftly."

"Are you doubting us again boss?" Lars raised his eyebrow, "If you're so scared of dying we can also just lure the creature away from the rings of this planet. You know doc got us anyway..."

"I hope the gauntlet day comes soon enough so I can stop working with you guys." He rolled his eyes, "Team, let's just get this over with right away."

The speakers within their ship sang a catchy jingle as an announcement for Rose's order, "I'm giving you an hour, don't let me down! Stay sharp and have fun!" And he was already gone.

"Y 'remember when doc used to tell us entire instructions?" Houston smiled, "Not even a single mention of the cube we gotta use for the beast, I bet he's gonna want this creature for his new aquarium."

"Oh you bet!" Lars replied with excitement, grabbing onto the control stick and the thruster control, "Let's get it over with just as Bill wants it."

"Okay, people, don't mess up. Peace." Bill put on a headset which would let him control the ship's weaponry, whilst also giving him a third-person view of the whole ship from the back. "Warnie, get in your position too."

"‼ ☼" Warnie unbuckled from her seat and stood up. She turned 2D and fell flat on the floor, assimilating with the ship and becoming one with it.

"Houston you ready?" Lars looked at them with an eager look.

"'Course I am! Let's do-" And before Houston could finish their sentence, Lars already set the ship's thrusters ablaze, significantly pushing everyone back and going full speed forward.

The ship continued to fly through the asteroid field, no beast in sight. Perhaps it could've been a false alarm, but that can't be it, there were very real reports coming from this place. Lars decided to shift the way out of the asteroid field for safety and Bill's growing unease. "Let me contact doc again..."

Suddenly, faint organic sounds could be heard just at the front of them, as if a mouth growled and opened. The beast's reflective invisible skin wore off and it revealed itself, a serpentine leviathan with a flower-like collar that was about to devour their ship whole, larger than any skyscraper built. Lars and Houston shrieked as they grabbed the control sticks with full force and steered away from its bite. "I'm not dying this way, hell no!" And the thrusters set ablaze once more. The creature's whole body twirled through the space, trying to trap the crew in a dome for consumption. Bill set off the ship's built-in fireworks to try to blind and distract the beast, but to no avail. The ship's catchy jingle played and doc's commentary was inbound.

"OH! This one must be interested in the machinery of the ship! Do not get eaten at any cost, I want this beast. Over."

"The hell does he mean by that!?" Houston managed to say as they pulled the stick violently, performing evasive maneuvers.

"Is the cube even gonna work?!" Bill spoke out, noticing the sheer size of the creature, "What defines 'less than dwarf-planet sized'?!"

The creature's petals shined, all seven of them, and it unleashed an energy strike comparable to lightning. It hit the ship's left thruster leaving it severely damaged.

"?! ?! ?! ?!" Warnie signaled, immediately moving onto the thruster to fix it from within. Maneuverability was key here, they couldn't lose it.

The ship's friendly jingle played again, "Oh yes, forgot to mention, fire as you need. I can recover the beast, but don't kill it!"

"Exactly what I needed to hear." Bill scoffed as he got his thumbs on the triggers.

"I think 'less than dwarf-planet sized' means moon-" Houston was interrupted by the incredibly loud sound of the ship's many machine guns firing, "and like-" Houston's voice was completely muted under the endless barrage, "and we could-" Finally, the machine guns stopped.

"It's ineffective, can you repeat that?"

"I ain't repeatin' all that screw you." Houston rolled their eyes, "Lars you heard the plan right?"

He shook his head with widened eyes.

"Great." Houston got off their seat, "Just cover me."

"Ayo where the hell are you going?!" Lars' grew quickly concerned, right before the lightning struck the ship again destroying multiple turrets at once.

"The control unit, duh!" They smiled, "I'm takin' a handful of cubes so keep an eye out on me."

"Just say the plan again dude!" And Houston was nowhere to be seen, "Bill you suck ass at being a leader!"

"Not my business."

"This is ALL your business, what?!" He was bewildered.

The ship's voice sounds, "CONTROL UNIT-I. Deploying... Deploying..."

The control units were exactly like the guardian-class ship they were operating, except smaller, fit for just a single person. They have to be connected to the main ship with a tube, or else they can only last around fifteen minutes without a main power source. Houston managed to fit in swiftly with their cat too, "Lars, you know we got comms on these too right?"

"I forgot." Lars sighed, "Alright, tell me what's the plan."

"I'll throw this bag of cubes right into it's mouth."

"That's gonna be such a pain to sort through dude."

"What else are you suggesting?"

"Fine, let's do it!"

As the first control unit deploys, Warnie attempts to fix the turrets of the ship, though unsuccessful many times. Houston has already loaded the cubes into the control unit's only launcher.

"Team we need to open this beast's mouth somehow without endangering ourselves." Lars speaks up.

"Make it sneeze! Shoot a mortar into its nose!" Houston shoots up many suggestions right off the bat.

"Can this thing even sneeze!?" Bill confusedly asks.

"¤ x ‼" Warnie signals, the turrets don't work and cannot be fixed right now.

"Guess we'll have to bait it, bring it on!" Lars gets ahold of the thruster control, "Houston, copy all my movements so you don't get dragged along."

"Saying that like as if it were my first time." They laugh it off.

With careful maneuvers, almost trivial for both of them, across the whole asteroid field, they manage to get a perfect shot in. The velocity of the cubes would not be instant, Warnie had to do a precise calculation to not waste all their cubes right away. Under her signal, Houston waited to fire as the beast...

"Fifty-seven minutes... Fifty-eight minutes... Fifty-nine minutes..." Rose counted, impatiently.

A sudden white flash lit up the center of the hangar, and the Omega team was finally back. The ship was completely slimy, and so was the crew. Something strange must've happened, but Houston walked up to Rose and handed him a dirty bag full of cubes. "One of these got the creature."

"What! You consider this a job well done! Atrocious, you better start sorting it out now!" Rose was furious.

The team looked at each other, thinking the same question, who did the least this mission? All fingers were pointed to the boss, Bill.

"Bill..." Rose looked at him, "You know your performance has to improve for the gauntlet ceremony."

"There was nothing I could do there! The weapon systems were completely ineffective." He argued.

"No time to mess with that, retrieve the beast from the bag, and it'll be a job well done." Rose handed the bag to him.

"Okay..." He groaned.

"For the rest of you! Mission is over, return to your rooms. Out!" So commanding.

"We're not gonna talk about what happened, right? Like ever?" Houston quietly spoke to Lars.

"You think he'll mind having the beast just chopped up in cubes?" He started sneering, "Oh, his reaction's gonna be priceless."

In the New Babylon, it was just yet another afternoon. Today was a music festival in the park that Houston and Lars were looking forward to. Fireworks blew up in the sky, and music of any genre started blaring from the podium that has been there for over a week now. Lars held Houston's hand, and they immediately trailed off into the park after getting out of the museum's hidden elevator. That grand museum was their new home, has been after they graduated together. The festival was crowded, filled with various stands to buy incredibly expensive stuff from.

"Yo, Houst, I don't think I'm feeling too well."

"Hm?" They tilted their head.

And immediately after, Lars started gagging. It alerted Houston immediately, they came closer to Lars' slouched over body as he pulled out a small flower from his mouth. That flower was a piece of the beast they just captured, with its seven complete petals. "Ta-dah! For you!" Lars seemed fine.

"Ew, gross!" Houston laughed it off, taking the flowers from his hand, "You seriously shoved an unknown beasts' piece into your mouth?! You're crazy!"

"Had to try at least one time." He smiled. They began walking to the festival again.

Houston took a moment appreciating the flower, it looked alien, more alien than anything they've ever seen in the outer cosmos. They smiled, "I'll be keeping this one with me."

"You better!" He stretched his arms back, "Took forever to find that one in the pile of cubes!"

"You've been through them already!?" Houston's eyes widened.

"Bill was gonna stay with Rose afterwards anyway. Gave him something to do as they chat about some gauntlet again."

Once they've reached the festival they visited all the stands they could. Money wasn't a problem under Rose's life, they could afford whatever they pleased. They played minigames, ate cotton candy of strange shapes, acting like kids. They always lived each day like as if it were their last, unafraid to live how they wished. Their identities, their accomplishments during missions, all was kept private from the public. The technology they used was also private, and no word from it was allowed to be shared with the city. They wasted so much time with the stands, it was okay, the festival was getting delayed due to some inconveniences.

There was one peculiar minigame they visited.

"Hit the main queen bug with the sniper to earn a grand prize." Lars carefully read the rules, "Sheesh, that target is so small!"

"Seems kinda offensive to scornite people don't you think?" Houston raised an eyebrow.

"It's hosted by one." He shrugs.

"I'd be down to give it a try." Houston smiled.

And right after saying that, they paid for an attempt with cash. Houston picked up the toy sniper and carefully aimed at the many targets. To receive the prize, Houston would have to hit the exact center, not even millimeters from it would count. With deep breaths...

"Damn, so locked in." Lars was intrigued.

Houston fired, and they managed to hit the bare edge of the target. Disappointing, they won absolutely nothing.

"Aw..." They looked down.

"It's fine, dude!" He cheered them on, "That one was built to be impossible anyway."

"I liked one of the prizes though." They looked at Lars with pleading eyes.

Lars dug his hand into his pocket and pulled out the exact small prize they wanted.

"I- What-...!" Houston was flabbergasted.

"It was this one, right?" He smiled.

"Since when!? What?!"

"I saw you looking at it with puppy eyes, figures you'd want it." He laughed, "Is it really stealing if it's from scammers? It's so insignificant, anyway."

That prize was a small stuffed toy. A black and white checkered rabbit keychain.

"Thank you so much!" They squealed.

"Glad to make ya happy."

The actual festival has finally started. The music that played before was only just a prelude for what was to come. They both stood amidst the giant crowd and waited for the bands of any and all genres to come. The New Babylon was perfect for such events, anyone popular enough would be interested in visiting this place. Houston, a crazy fan of one specific genre, pulled out two glowsticks from their pockets to wave when a certain artist stepped on the podium. Lars would even let them get on his back for a better view. During the more rock band entries Lars would go crazy, they were both really into music, and they spent hour after hour standing there and cheering the bands on.

"That was a pretty fun day."

"True."

Back at the museum's interior, in a whole sub-section where they all had their own rooms. Taking a hot bath together, Houston and Lars. Their hair was bubbly from all the shampoo, Lars was often a huge help in washing their long hair.

"So much has happened in the two years."

"It has, though I've been wondering what's there to come next?"

"The race, duh!"

"But what then? Do we continue doing more research missions for Rose?"

"I was thinkin', wouldn't that be the perfect time to retire? After our race, we gain our fame, and we live in eternal luxury."

"It seems so easy."

"I wonder what Rose would have to say about retiring, he values us a lot."

"We ain't the only ones capable of such missions, there are totally so many other sparks out there waiting to be lit."

"Fair."

Lars wrapped their arms around Houston, a warm touch that would last in the sea of bubbles... which was swiftly interrupted by a call, the whole team was getting called over at night for no clear reason.
