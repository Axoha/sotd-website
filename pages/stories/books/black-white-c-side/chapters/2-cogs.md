Lars and Houston were sat together on one bench at an average department building to attend to their problems. They've been waiting there for over two hours by this point, today was a busy day. Each time the door opened they got their hopes up, only for the person inside to call someone else in line. Lars listened to music on their ancient music player as Houston was on their super-old-generation phone browsing through all the pictures and recordings they managed to snap during the race. Outside of the first thirty minutes where they talked about the race together, their wait was completely silent with only faint music coming from Lars' earbuds filling up the noise. Suddenly, the door opens, everyone's ears perk up in the room,

"Number six-hundred and one come in."

Lars looks at their queue line, six-hundred o' two. They're so close, he lets out a sigh and looks to the sides. Houston's phone catches his eye.

"How did you manage to take these?" He raises an eyebrow.

"Um." Houston stammers, "The sky looked pretty!"

"You had this ancient phone in your cockpit? That could've flown out from your pocket and shatter into a million pieces, but you totally already knew that."

"*No I didn't.*" They whisper to themselves, "Um, yeah, I knew that! I totally have secure pockets to ensure nothing flies out." They say, nodding.

"You were also literally like, going out of your cockpit while racing, stealing other people's fuel. That's so completely insane to me! And they didn't even stop you!"

"That was a risk I had to take." They looked back at their phone, which was significantly cracked upon closer look. "You know, I didn't even read the rules before-"

"Good lord." Lar's eyes widen.

"I watched the races a lot throughout my whole life! I remember seeing one of the niche racers do that one time..."

"You mean Jelly Hubert as number three-hundred-twelve? During the special race of 2742?"

"That one! How do you know this?" They tilt their head to a side.

"I watched the races a lot as a kid too! Always been a dream to participate in one..." He smiled.

"Sorry that I probably tarnished our whole dream of becoming famous racers." Houston looked down with disappointed eyes.

"What are you talking about? It was amazing! Like I said before, nothing like this has happened in ages. Without you this race would've been yet another one of those boring ones." Yet Lars was still geeking out.

"I suppose." Houston tried to smile back.

The door opened again. "Number six-hundred-two-"

"About damn time." Lars was already on their way before the person even managed to finish their sentence. They both sat down rather quickly behind a desk, a grumbly aged manager slouched over and gestured with their hands.

"You two caused a lot of trouble, eh?"

Houston gulps, Lars doesn't really care.

"You should know how to behave for your age, your legal guardians and parents are not responsible for you anymore." They looked closely through their documents, "Broke many laws and rules, Houston March. You were not even registered in the race, rigged the system to accept your illegal racer ID and hover-machine... Lars May Terma, their actions affect you as well."

Another person arrived in the room holding a rather scrunchy black cat.

"Houston, is this cat yours?" He raised an eyebrow.

It meowed, unmoving as it was held under its upper legs. It was stretched, the person did not know how to hold a cat.

"Yes, that's my cat! Her name is Sweetie!" Houston was baffled, slightly angered.

"Your fellow assistant here is trained well, able to operate with computers, sneaking into an operator's room unnoticed. The ability to create a hover-machine with nothing but scraps is also impressive, you have talent, don't throw it away."

The cat, Sweetie, was given back to Houston gently. Lars looked at the beast and thought maybe that was the reason they were waiting so long.

"To your legal punishment., for all the rules and law broken..." The manager shuffled the documents tidily and gently put them into a paper shredder, "Pardoned, all of it."

Their eyes widened, "Pardoned?!"

"Yes, indeed, someone special wanted to see you. They asked to take full responsibility of your actions." The manager took their glasses off, "Rose."

"The Citadelarian? That artist?!" Their voices synchronized, asking questions.

"We don't know what he wants from you both, but we know he is eager to meet you. Your display of skill that was broadcast all across the world have interested him. Having such a figure take you into their hands must be an honor, you should be proud of yourselves, but remember to not repeat the same mistakes. Know the law, or else the consequence will be dire."

Houston and Lars were in disbelief, but in the good way. For a moment they thought their lives were about to progressively crash down. Sweetie meowed again at Houston, demanding chin scratches.

"He asks to meet you in front of the grand museum at six o' clock sharp, if you can't make it let us know now, otherwise you're free to go." He grabbed a plastic cup to drink water.

They both got up from their chairs, "Thank you." And left with a goodbye.

"Can you believe it? Man, from despair to opportunity!" Lars smiled, stretching his arms to the sky.

Houston was a bit busy playing with their cat, making cutesy noises and rubbing its neck as she demanded more. She was being carried in their arms like a baby. "Oh, definitely! Though I do wonder what someone like Rose would want from us..."

"Y'know, it's super hard to tell. Maybe he'll give us an opportunity to get hired in a crazy-paying job, or... We'll serve as like, figures, for him to paint whenever he wants, that'd probably be a well-paying job too?"

"I'd sure hope so." Houston blurted out, "Your mind works in interesting ways."

"Hey, if not, we get more time to graduate! Even though I'm failing pretty much already, an escape would be awesome. Where do you study? Unless you're done already, I wouldn't be surprised."

Houston's warm feeling fades as they look to the side, "Um... I don't study, or have a job. I haven't graduated either."

"Whhhaaaattt?!?!" He was shocked, "What do you do?!"

"Live."

"Well, in a warm home with parents I imagine, I gotta get you out there-"

"I live in the alleys, my parents died in an accident two years ago." They said, with a slight hint of sadness.

"Oh... That stings." His fun mood turned more serious, "Someone like you doesn't belong in the alleys! That's so unfair! Apparently you engineered a whole hover-machine and in the alleys of all places!? I imagine your guardians, if any, don't even care." He seemed really mad about it.

"There you are!" An unrecognizable voice came from another side.

"Who-"

Rose stood at the front of the entrance to the museum. For his small body, they would've missed him easily. They didn't even realize it was six already, he must've planned this perfectly, somehow.

"Oh!" Lars walked up to him instantly to shake hands, Houston would proceed to do the same.

"Please to meet both of you." Rose nodded, "How special for us to meet at this time, your performance blew my eye! So reckless, so smart, for two young adults you're destined to bloom into unlimited potential! Come with me, people like you are exactly who I'm looking for."

And so, Houston and Lars took their first steps in the grand museum, littered with many golden artifacts from an age unknown. Such sights were overwhelming for the two, they both felt tiny in comparison to the exhibitions showcased. They shared talks, Rose asked many questions, likely way too many. They took a long elevator ride that led underground where Rose's personal studio was located in secret. Very spacious and odd, the two would see a machine's true creativity for the first time. 

"What are we here for, anyway?" Houston asked, surprisingly late.

"An offer." Rose turned his head back, "It's been alluded to, but I wait for the perfect time. We must get there first."

"*Artists are always kind of weird.*" Lars scratched their chin as they thought.

"Now, perfect." Rose got to a closed steel gate, suspiciously thick. He opened it with the swipe of a card and a glimmering golden ship stood at the center of the hangar.

"SPS-999." Rose crossed their arms, "One of my greatest masterpieces to date."

"Woah..." Lars and Houston both looked with widened eyes, mouths open.

"This is completely confidential. No word of this ship have reached the surface. It is fit with my newest technology that can transfer cells from one place to another instantaneously without the need to completely erase the original. It still needs tons of tests, experiments, but it works, safely."

"So like, teleportation?" Houston raised an eyebrow.

"Precisely." Rose slowly nodded, "Not the destructive kind, though."

"There's kinds to it?"

"I will not answer that." He shook his head.

"Are you asking us to pilot this thing?" Lars was completely possessed by it, walking closer towards it to touch it with the palm of his hand. The surface of the ship had odd markings reminiscent of something ancient.

"I seek talent each year. Finding someone special to fulfill the necessary spots of a team I've been assembling to figure out the secrets of the universe. You two would make the greatest pilots in all the galaxies I've been to, as long as you train under my program." Rose started to speak grand, the future looming over the two.

"Wouldn't it be smarter to get someone experienced? Someone who's already capable?" Houston tilted their head, thinking in a more pessimistic way.

"There's more to it than experience. I'm not interested in skill, I'm interested in you two. I feel that great things will come if we work together."

"Um..."

"Houston? Come on! Easiest yes ever!" Lars eagerly cheered on Houston.

"I'll accept it!" And they fell for the opportunity.

"We didn't even go over the schedules, the pay, you didn't even meet your future team! Don't rush art, I must tell you everything BEFORE you comply..."

"*Art?*"

Sweetie meowed again.

An hour and a half have passed. Obviously, they accepted Rose's offer and were let go once more. Houston left earlier than Lars, he had to stay longer to hear something about school complications and this offer. It was already dark outside, they would meet the crew tomorrow.

"They barely said bye..." Lars looked down as he walked back to his dorm through the park alone, "Man, the train rides are gonna be so annoying at this time."

The streetlamps passed by him one by one. The golden city's light emanating throughout the night sky filled Lars with a strange feeling, a comfortable cold feeling. He stopped to look up at the sky.

"Man, what am I doing."

Houston on the other side was simply just walking through the park, finding their way back to shelter that they had on a skyscraper's rooftop. Getting up there was always annoying but worth it in a sense. Right before climbing over a fence to make their way to the skyscraper, someone came running behind him.

"Houston!!!" Lars yelled out, "Wait up!"

"Lars?" Houston was confused, Sweetie also turned her head to him.

"Yo, wait for me next time dude!" They were sweating, panting, "This park is huge!"

"What's up...?" They asked, still confused.

"You can't live like this! You can live with me in my dorm! We can graduate together! Y'know, let's not waste such a friendship dude!"

Houston's eyes lightened, they didn't even realize they were making friends in the first place.

"Sorry... I get a little too caring for others." He scratched the back of his neck, looking away.

"Hey..." Houston slowly walked up to him, "Are you sure? Like a 100% sure?"

Lars smiled, "Dude, hell yeah!"
