"Deep breaths, deep breaths. This better be worth it, I got only one shot at this, I gotta make it."

Year 2758. Within the New Babylon the greatest race was gonna be held once more. Each four years, only once, across the whole planet through the seven golden capital cities. Fireworks blew right above the roofs of the skyscrapers beyond the clouds as the sun slowly set. The hyper-advanced vehicles of choice revved their engines, electric and gas, equipped with four thrusters and hovers to keep itself above the ground at all times. Designed to perform extreme maneuvers at top speeds, designed to blitz and teleport short distances, chaos was expected and so rescue teams were scattered everywhere near the racing track.

"NOW NOW, WHAT BEAUTIFUL WEATHER FOR SUCH A RACE!" The announcer went wild, as usual, "NO RAIN, NO SNOW, THE RACERS MUST BE SO RELIEVED!.."

The starting line was incredibly busy, whole teams prepared their hover-rides with hurry. The designs ranged from sleek to rough, racers from all across the universe partook in one of the greatest racing events of all time. Each hover-ride had a comfortable cockpit which would ensure the fullest-safety of the pilot, being see-through up to the pilot.

"AT THE SEVENTY-SECOND SPOT, WE HAVE... THE YOUNG LARS M. TERMA!"

"Can't believe that announcer is still going at it with the same voice, isn't he like forty by now?"

"The race is about to begin and you're focused on that?" His one assistant came around to chat.

"Eh."

"Don't 'eh' me dude."

"I wonder who all signed up this time."

"AT THE BOLD, SEVENTY-THIRD SPOT, THERE IS..." And the announcer went on.

"Ya think I'll win this time?"

"Eh."

"Copying me? I see."

"Sorry, perfect response!"

One of the racers' engines blows up, leaving a panicked team in its embers.

"Feels like each time you get placed lower, huh?"

"Shush."

"RACERS, IN YOUR MACHINES, IT'S TIME TO FINALLY SOAR INTO THE STARS!.. START YOUR ENGINES..."

The crowd roared, the racers proceeded to sit down into their cockpits and buckle their seatbelts. Lars took a deep breath as his team gave a final thumbs up with a smile before running off to the sidelines. Focus, focus. Over a hundred racers, one Lars. Seven capital cities, thousands of miles, twelve hours. Lars closed his cockpit and put on a headset that allowed him to see the front, sides, and back simultaneously. The hover-machines' engines blazed, flying above the asphalt as a countdown began. Focus! 

"THE DRIVERS ARE AT THE LINE AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ALMOST SET... READY... SET... GO!!!"

With a boom, a cacophony of pure chaos, the hover-machines flew off with instant speed. Lars' poor acceleration let him at a seventieth place off the start, passing two other machines with worse acceleration. It did not matter, what mattered was general performance and skill. Saint Kalina was notorious for its sharp turns, the roads could adapt to any form in need of traffic incidents, but for this day they're used as ramps and alternate ways. Of course, at first place was a famous racer, known for winning multiple of these races over the course of their career. The top ten have usually won before, leaving no space for new contestants. Their hover-machines were just too good! Top acceleration, top speed, top maneuverability... it can go on. Multiple crashes have occurred already in blazing explosions, but to no worry, the cockpits kept the pilots safe and the disintegrating material of the hover-machines ensured no debris would reach to harm anyone.

"Maow." A collared cat jumped on the announcer's desk, as he continued to yell on.

"What's this?" The announcer turned to his guards, "Is this a joke? Did you let this beast here?"

"No?" The two guards replied at the same time.

Meanwhile, the cat walked over the computer of the announcer which monitored the race. Pressing specific keys on the keyboard, leaping away and running off before the guards could catch it.

"Whatever that was about..." The announcer rolled their eyes, adjusting their microphone, "...SEEMS LIKE RACER-72 IS KEEPING UP A STRONG PACE! SO EARLY ON!.."

One's reactions must've been the best to excel in this race, the roads shifted in unthinkable ways. The hover-machines could stick to sides, ceilings, cluttered like bugs on the main streets of Saint Kalina. 

"I got only one shot at this, I gotta make it!!!"

Engines of an unknown, scrappy hover-machines blazed. Abruptly coming off the dark sidelines of the city, endangering multiple civilians. Their cockpit was still open! Their hover-machine going at extreme speeds!

"WHAT'S THIS?! WHO'S THAT?! A MYSTERIOUS RACER UNDER THE NUMBER 'SEVEN TWENTY' CAME TO JOIN THE RACE!? ARE THEY EVEN ON THE LIST!?"

Their position turned last despite joining the horde of machines so late. Enforcers, or more so the security, immediately got into action with their own hover-machines. The mysterious racer struggled to close their cockpit, but it was near impossible due to how fast they were going. Their hover-machine was made of scraps, something that looked like it wasn't going to last very long. Lars was deeply focused, listening to the announcer's transmission as he continued to pass other racers like nothing.

"SEEMS LIKE WE'VE GOT COMMOTION! THIS MYSTERY RACER IS GONNA GET THEMSELVES KILLED- What's that? Oh. They're a part of the race!? Since when?!- APOLOGIES, THIS IS RACER SEVEN-TWENTY AT THE LAST SPOT! HOUSTON MARCH!.."

Lars raised an eyebrow, and many other racers. The pilots could also watch a live broadcast from birds-eye view, this new racer was going to die for sure. The enforcers have caught up to Houston's hover-machine, surrounding them from both sides and the behind. A worried expression struck them, but, surprisingly, the enforcers only made their cockpits transparent and signaled with their hands to swiftly tell them to close their cockpit in an alternate way. They listened, and the cockpit managed to close with the pull of a unique lever. The enforcers let them be, disbanding back into the sidelines. Houston's hover-machine then kicked off with more speed, catching up to the racer ahead of them.

"Eighteen years old? No racing experience? Dear god! Who let this kid sign up?!"

Young Houston's mind was on total overdrive. Secure this, focus on that, unlike a majority of the racers they did not use a headset. Their cockpit had small windows to see through, driving like in the older times. Timing a gear-shift and a clutch slam at the right time, Houston managed to pass their first racer. Lars on the other hand was at a firm twelfth spot, right behind the glorious top ten. The Saint Kalina's section was over, the race moved into its first highway.

"HOUR AFTER HOUR, THE RACERS ARE KEEPING ON AT A STEADY PACE! ONLY TWO-HUNDRED CRASHES SO FAR, NO INCIDENTS AS USUAL! OUR MYSTERY RACER IS STILL AT IT EVER-SO SLIGHTLY MURDERING OPPOSING BOTTOM-TIER RACERS WITHOUT CRASHING! HOW DOES THIS YOUNGSTER MANAGE TO FLY SUCH A WRECK?! FROM WHERE DID THEY EVEN GET IT FROM!?"

"What an interesting sign-up..." Lars chuckled, driving right behind the 11th spot in a more passive tactic.

Houston's hover-machine signaled them with fuel, it was running really low. They accounted for this problem, not even having a personal team to refuel at checkpoints. The highways of the race were always more peaceful than the streets of the capital cities, but incredibly fuel-hungry. In a shocking move, Houston turned on the hover-machine's autopilot and opened the cockpit to step out onto the steel scrappy plates of their vehicle wearing special shoes to keep themselves in place.

"WH- WHAT IS THAT MYSTERY RACER UP TO!?"

Houston held a modified sharp tube in their hands, plowing through the fierce winds to reach the opposing racer they've been tailgating. With a stab, they managed to hit the opposing hover-machine's fuel canister, and all their fuel's been drained to refuel their own. That action left the announcer completely speechless, the snoozing racer ahead of Houston didn't even notice.

"Is- Is that even legal? Can they do that?!" 

The manager only shrugged in response with the same surprised look.

Lars on the other hand was keeping a steady pace, managing to surpass the tenth spot already. Such a nobody like Lars, the audience was eagerly awaiting for what could happen next. The top ten were known to be really aggressive if anyone passed them. Hours passed, cities were conquered. Lars fell down to the fifteenth but managed to climb the spots again, only to fall back down eventually. It all came down to the last hour in a capital city which didn't hold anything special, but was in fact a normal race track for once. Over 60% of the racers crashed, the spaces between racers were either really tight or really wide. Lars managed to get on the ninth spot again, ignoring the mean stares coming from the famous racers. He thought of a new tactic, with a precise gear shift and...

Houston came by blazing through the gaps of the top ten with a burning hover-machine. Eighth, seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, they were going too fast! Houston frantically pulled levers and pressed buttons within their cockpit, often resorting to using their janky headset to keep sight of everyone else. The top ten was NOT pleased, they all made a collective effort to finally shut down the mystery racer. With rams, smashes, blockades, there was no way their hover-machine would last until the end of the race. One of the prestige racers managed to knock a whole thruster out of Houston's hover-machine, sending them into an uncontrollable spin right away. This whole ordeal made the audience go wild, nothing like this has happened in their history of racing since whole decades. Lars eyed the situation carefully, all the racers were too busy knocking Houston out, leaving so much space to seize the first spot... he decided to back down and lock one of his thrusters with Houston's scrappy hover-machine. He opened his terminal and got into contact with Houston.

"Hey." With a pleasant sounding ringtone, Houston picked up. "You have been pulling some dangerous stunts bro! You could've died right there!"

"Y-Yeah!?" Houston responded with youthful panic, "W-Why would you do that?!"

"Your machine is fast, I like that." He smiled, "You're gonna be my fifth thruster, got it?"

"U-Um." Houston struggled to find words, "Yeah, for sure!"

Lars re-organized their thrusters to have all four at the front and Houston at the back. This procedure cost them a few leaderboard spots, but there was still time to pass the top ten. On Lars' signal Houston decided to go all in, setting their hover-machine to ignore any and all limits. Managing to decimate all competition, from the fiftieth to eighth spot right away. Time was running low, the racers were approaching the finish line at absurd speeds. It was so close, only a few more difficult turns left and the next generation's champion would be decided.

"IN AN INCREDIBLE BURST OF SPEED THE MYSTERY RACER AND LARS HAVE RAMMED INTO THE NUMBER ONE CHAMPION LIKE AS IF THEY WERE BEING CHASED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF! THE SUDDEN DUO SEEM TO BE PUSHING THE CHAMPION FORWARD LEADING THEM TO AN UNCONTROLLABLE STATE! THE CHAMPION IS CLEARLY SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, BUT THE TWO OF THEM SHOW NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN AT ALL?! THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN MAKE THIS! NEXT TURN IN TIME, I CAN'T BARE TO WATCH!!!"

...

Celebration poppers banged, confetti flew all around, fireworks flew up in the sky and exploded miraculously.

"The next champion is... Mina Olberia, the first ever champion for the Scornite species! Round of applause, make some noise everybody!!!"

Houston, Lars, and the previous champion were all sat together in the recovery room all bruised up in complete silence. The champion was incredibly not happy, Houston gripped their knees feeling really bad, and Lars... he enjoyed all of it. Sure, they would get in a lot of trouble, but Lars couldn't shake off that feeling he felt in the race. He looked at Houston, and gave them a re-assuring smile.

"Bro, after we're over with the punishments, hit me up. That was rad as hell."
