"...The newly unveiled team 'Omega' are set to go on their first ever expedition..."

"...As a part of stage one of the gauntlet's ceremony, the team must conduct a deep dive into the gauntlet's origin..."

"...Beloved Bill is a part of the team, how marvelous!.."

The people cheered for the team as they were all sat in a luxury car, transported into a launchpad faraway. The ship's teleportation function was not revealed, so they had to make it look legit. The radio played the news, announcers were excited, no time for music.

"So many lies." Lars grumbled, "Why did Rose have to make us so public all of a sudden?"

"Publicity I guess." Houston shrugged, petting their cat, "He can't be so dead, he must show off his project every now and then. I guess now he had nothing to show but us."

"♫♫♫ Σ Σ π?" Warnie signaled. 

"No time for that." Lars shook his head.

Of course Bill was sat with Rose in a different car. Compared to them, the rest of the team seemed like filler. Lars just continued to look outside the window, headphones in his ears, thinking about the dream he had earlier. The launch was stationed at an empty desert, close to where the capital city was. Fortunately for them it was empty around, the whole crowds were moved to one expensive spot far away for the 'best view'. The team, dressed in their pilot outfits they've been using for years, valiantly step out of the cars to walk towards their ship together. They had to look great for the cameras. Houston was slightly nervous about the sudden public spotlight, but Lars' mind was somewhere else. He glanced over at them, and after some quick thought he decided to nudge his way closer to Houston. That seemed to calm them.

"Yo, y'know we wanna be stars someday right?" He spoke up.

"Y-yeah." They scratched the back of their hair.

"Time to soak in the fame." He stretched, "They're chanting stuff such as, 'Good luck out there!', 'We love you!'. Ain't that nice."

Houston thought about it, eyes darting away from him. All those compliments from the public flew completely over their head, they never really received any from strangers. They suddenly became flustered and even more nervous than ever before.

"Um..." Lars didn't expect such reaction, "It's okay! They love you like this too!"

Interestingly enough, Rose was nowhere to be seen with the team. Turns out he was just working in secret, behind the scenes, for reasons they couldn't get. Maybe it was due to Citadelarians not being welcome in other civilizations, no one truly knew. The team took an elevator ride up the launch tower, their ship was attached to one big rocket which would be launched to space soon. Pointless, but it would look cool for the cameras. The team found their way into the ship and sat at their own respective comfy seats, except this time they struggled to even reach their seats due to the whole ship facing upwards with the rocket. They had to help each other climb up the interior, their ship was built for anything but this.

"Let's get this over with already." Bill didn't sound so happy, he was the last to sit down.

"Yo, what's up?" Lars looked back at him, "Public too much for ya?"

"Don't even talk." He was not having it.

"‼‼‼" Warnie signaled, seemingly frustrated.

"Maybe Rose just did this to distract us from the fact we're about to meet God, Warnie." Houston stared at their console, "Ain't that super odd? He hates the public."

"Willingly famous yet he hates the public, won't ever understand that." Bill pressed a few buttons on his seat to initiate the launch sequence, "Buckle up, team."

"Buckle up..." Houston thought about that, remembering that they smuggled their cat onboard. She was in his suit the whole time, head sticking out of the neck to observe her surroundings.

And suddenly, the countdown began. The people joyfully counted down with their voices directly from their hearts. For them, it was a special occurrence, for the team, it was just an unusual day. The launch tower lit up with fire and smoke from below, and the ship ascended up into the stars, safely. The team have never gone through the standard procedure of lifting off, they were not used to the intense shaking of the interior, or even feeling the gravity in that matter. Everything in the New Babylon during this age has been silky smooth, this was not. Everyone felt so relieved once they left the atmosphere and entered space, the launch experience made them all believe for a moment that it was genuinely over. 

"Where even is this planet Rose wants us to get on so bad..." Lars, shaken up, opens up his console and checks the navigation.

The ship's friendly jingle played again, "Hey hey hey! Still Alive? Perfect, rocket boosters and main external tanks disposed? Splendid! All of this was not easy to set overnight! All for the comfort of you! After more investigation from my third-party sources it seems like your destined location may just be ruins, after all, no worries! Now get out there!" And Rose was gone.

"Just ruins." Houston scratched their chin, as the location information was inserted into the ship's databank.

"That's pretty far..." Lars was surprised, "Like, at the edge of the whole universe!"

"Is there even an edge?" Houston tilted their head.

"Nah, but if there was it'd be somewhere around there." He circled around the designated system with his index finger.

The teleportation sequence of the ship began. Through a countdown, they appear from one place to another in mere seconds. The planet they were meant to land on was simply named 'Gen-72', a small and gray dwarf planet that could easily be mistaken for a moon. They had to perform scans of the atmosphere to even make sure if it's safe to land on, the fogs and the clouds were incredibly thick, obscuring most of the planet's surface.

"Have we ever seen a colorless planet before? There's genuinely nothing here." Houston turned around and asked.

"One time." Bill responded, arms crossed, "But we haven't been there, you don't remember?"

"I don't remember all the missions boss."

"Rose specifically told us to land on this massive crater, seems safe enough to me. Better not be another one of those missions where we fly through the surface's cracks and get attacked by an underground monster again." Lars spoke as he checked the surface of the planet.

"Has anyone ever step foot on this planet?" Houston turned to Lars.

"No..." He was unsure, "I guess we'll figure out from where the crater comes from, it does seem like its just ruins."

Lars picked a safe location to descend to, somewhere around the crater. Whilst entering the atmosphere the fog made each of them nervous, and as they went deeper the fog got even darker. This planet was orbiting a dying star who's rays were escaping like worms. The ship landed with a loud thud, it was incredibly dark outside. Temperatures were freezing. Sweetie the cat was told to stay inside the ship.

"Put on your goggles." Bill commanded, "There's no way this fog is getting cleared up."

"On it." Lars quickly responded.

Warnie didn't need any goggles, somehow she could see even without them. Their suits thankfully had a thermal function which would adjust to any and most temperatures in range, providing warmth and coolness under the pilot's setting. Through the goggles, each of them could see far distances, the whole crater was exposed for their eyes to see.

"Ruins." Houston muttered, "Ruins of a giant building, he was right."

"That's such a long walk! Come on, let's get the bikes ready." Lars went back to the ship right away.

Portable electric bikes, capable of recharging in direct sunlight, capable of shrinking down to fit right into anyone's pocket. They had to modify one of the wheels to be treaded, a regular bike wouldn't do much in the harsh snowy terrain. After setting up, the four of them positioned alongside each other and set off to the center of the crater. Houston and Lars, as usual, would race against each other with friendly banter, but Warnie would somehow always get there first. The surface of the planet was empty, snowy, tons of unusual reflective black spikes which pierced the ground. The ruins were fully black too, touching the bricks felt incredibly wrong.

"Quartz flooring, stained glass." Houston looked around, "Super dark, too."

"Feels like New Babylon's structure." Lars added, "What's this?" He sighted the metal remnants of something unknown.

"Looks like a collider prototype." Bill thought, "The ones we build to learn more about existence itself."

"Could be the downfall of this place." Houston observed the ruins more closely.

The friendly jingle played inside Bill's goggles, "Hey! I want to see! I told you to call me once you get there!"

"Yeah, yeah. My apologies." Bill nodded, "Any idea what all this is about?"

"Absolutely not so far! Look more!" Rose was clearly excited

"So commanding." Bill smirked.

"There's some readable text here!" Lars yelled all across the interior of the ruins as he stepped on glass flooring, his voice echoed, "*During the late 21st century, humanity was in complete ruin. Shattered, broken...*" As he read, the stained glass beneath him cracked.

"Lars!!!" Houston leapt out to him, noticing the unstable flooring.

"W-" Before he could say anything, the glass shattered, making them both plummet downwards into the underground of the ruins.

They fell directly through more glass.

**ꖡꖾꗍ ꕗꕯꖡꖾ ꗞꘘ ꖡꖾꗍ ꕷꗇꖀꗍꕒ ꖀꖾꕯꝆꕒ**

Each layer of glass hurt more, it was completely mute. And they fell, deeper into the abyss. The cold floor that awaited was not gonna be forgiving, they flailed their arms in complete desperation. Until...

They landed on white flowers. Soft, giant, comfortable flowers. They looked below themselves, right before sliding down slowly onto the cold, forgiving floor.

"Jeez." Lars held his head, "It hurts..."

Houston also struggled to move, glass shards were stuck to both of them. Their goggles and the only way to communicate, have been destroyed. Their pilot suits were tethered, sustaining most of the damage from the fall.

"Hello?"

"Huh?" Both Lars and Houston's heads turned to the same direction.

A small, black bear with white long hair walked from the shadows into the natural spotlight, where the flowers were basked in light. "Children?"

"Children?" Houston pointed at themselves, "No, we're adults."

Lars thought back to his dream. Back to Hazy's word.

*"We are the Inka, divine beings which are neither angels or demons..."*

"Inka..." He muttered.

"...Huh?" Houston was confused.

"You know us?" The Inka pointed at itself this time, "Golly, you must not be a children!"

"What's going on here?!" Houston coughed, struggling to stand, "Where are we?!"

"Do not move!" The small Inka ran up to Houston with its small legs.

"Don't-" They tried to push it away, but, Lars reassured them without saying anything.

The little Inka placed its small palms onto Houston's arms, and within moments, it was as if all their injuries just disappeared. "You, next. You bleed, you must be a special children."

Lars extended his hand to it, allowing it to heal his injury, too.

"Stop- Stop calling us children!" Houston backed away, worried and sickened. "Larmie?! Are you not worried?!"

"N-No, not really." He awkwardly replied, "Call me crazy, but, I've dreamt of these before. Like literally last night."

"Hazy must've you visited you! Oh, very special children!" The Inka enthusiastically added.

"What is going on?!" Houston was still panicking.

"Calm." The Inka tried to soothe Houston, "My name is Fenka, nice to meet you!" She reached her hand out to them. "And you too, Larmie!"

"My name is Lars, but nice to meet you." He had to bend over to shake hands with her. Houston, reluctantly also shook hands with her.

"We need to regroup, fast." Houston's mind was all over the place.

"Hey." Lars came closer to them, "Relax, maybe we're where Rose wanted us to be. Let's get as much information as we can out of this place, she could tell us a lot."

Houston took deep breaths, "I guess you're right." And they stood up, following right behind Lars.

Suddenly, Fenka started dancing. "♪ We are the Inka, divine beings neither angel or demon. We were created to fix life's greatest problems within the strings. That's what we were destined to do, yet, we wonder, why we were made to be so human!~ ♪" Her rhythm was kind of all over the place, but cute.

"Um, thanks." Houston awkwardly answered.

"I will protect you two. This is no place for children. With me on your side the guardians will not exterminate you." She smiled.

That comment left a slight sense of dread between Houston and Lars. "*Guardians?!*"

"What did you come here for, anyway?" She fully turned around, hands behind her back.

"We fell down here by accident." Lars scratched the back of his head.

"We came here to find out the gauntlet's origin, for our boss' order." Houston added.

"The... Gauntlet...?" Fenka was dazed.

"Yeah?" Houston was confused by her reaction.

"Follow me! This is very special!" She smiled again, quickly walking to a specific room. Houston and Lars took a moment to think about it, but they decided to follow.
