"Perfect, everyone is here on time, you never fail."

The room was dark as usual. This is where the divine golden gauntlet was stationed, of course. Lars and Houston were still wet, with towels and hastily put clothing over themselves.

"You couldn't have been dressed better?" Rose raised an eyebrow.

"You're calling us right on midnight!" Lars grouchily replied.

"Presence matters more than style, anyway." He dismissed it, "Do any of you except for Bill remember the original mythos of the gauntlet?" He spoke with a serious tone.

"No... Not really." Was the conclusion the rest came up to.

"Allow me to present." Rose got ready, "This gauntlet has been my muse for the longest time. A question I consider more important than the purpose of life. What is the origin? What is the meaning of all these paintings our ancestors left behind? I ask, everyday, and each week we get closer and closer to its answer."

The team listened carefully.

"Each week you achieve immeasurable feats, taking down leviathans as big as cities in less than an hour. No other team in the whole grand universe is capable of doing that! Our ancestors have always warned us to never build a tower to reach heaven, but, a divine opportunity such as this must be explored. Times have changed."

"What are you implying?" Houston got slightly confused.

"The gauntlet's place of origin has been discovered." Rose turned to look at the gauntlet, displayed in a glass case, "After all these years, after all the research."

The team knew about the warnings of the ancestors, it was a common legend that was taught in all the schools. By proceeding, they'd break through one important rule they thought to never break. "I don't have a good feeling about this." Houston honestly answered.

"Why is that gauntlet so important to us, anyway?!" Lars was more confused than ever, "Is this what our team was made for? All the expeditions and hunts were just for training?!"

"Not exactly." Rose swayed his index finger, "The gauntlet matters because the holder of it is capable of creating and changing everything that exists in the universe, as well to destroy. The paintings display an Angel we have named 'War', a faceless titan whose left arm was replaced to that of a gauntlet. According to the myth of the divine era, this titan was born to kill the tyrannical king that had tortured all of existence for the longest time. Bill was born using the genetic structure that was left behind in the gauntlet that was found in the year of 2735."

The inclusion of divine presence implied to be in their next mission left everyone uneasy.

"This is what the gauntlet ceremony has been about. Talked about by many, once we figure the complete secret of the gauntlet, Bill will become the successor of 'War' and usher a new peaceful era for us to live in."

"Being the successor of 'War' does NOT sit right with me." Lars shook their head, "That just sounds like we'll escalate the chaos even more!"

"Ah, thank you, for reminding me. Pardon." Rose's eyes widened, proceeding to point at a different grand painting at the ceiling lit up by one spotlight. "Bill is not to become 'War', literally, Bill is set to become the opposite."

That painting had a white and red anthropomorphic cat figure embalmed in golden light. The figure had a red heart on its chest, as well as a red halo and wings. "'Love', the one entity that appears in just this one painting. The titan is always portrayed as black and white, whilst love is colored with red. Bill matches love more, personality and appearance wise."

Houston raised their eyebrow as they looked at Bill, throughout the two years he definitely did not seem so lovely as Rose describes.

"It may be confusing, Love never had a gauntlet. But we do not know anything about this era, that's why we need to go to its origin tomorrow. Get a good night's sleep, dismissed." He abruptly cut the meeting off, the team disbanded. Bill stayed behind as usual.

"I don't like that." Lars was clearly stressed, "I don't believe in any religion or something, but man, I'm scared."

"He totally could've been more descriptive with what the origin even is." Houston was also slightly worried, "Better not have to fly into like a black hole or something."

"I don't wanna meet anything divine dude! There better be just ruins..."

The rest of their walk back to their room was filled a conversation about what they just heard. It was around one hour into the next day, a full quality sleep was unlikely. Once they fell exhausted onto their bed, their cat Sweetie joined in between them both. She started to repeatedly paw at the blankets and purr.

"Y'know I think it'll all be fine in the end." Houston yawned, stretching their arms.

"I guess..." Lars scratched Sweetie's chin. Houston was already snoozing facing away from Lars covered in layers of blankets. They must have been really tired after the whole day. Lars turned off the lights and laid on the bed looking at the ceiling, shuffling through his fingers he had on his chest. With a close of their eyes.

"Open your eyes."

A mysterious voice echoed through the darkness.

"Let's play a game of chess."

Lars opened his eyes, and ho, he found himself at a place between existence and nothingness. He frantically turned around, except his movement was slow, reaction, feelings were more abstract than one could imagine. "Where, where am I...?" His voice sound tired, but his mind begged for it to be more confused, energetic. At the front of him sat a black skinny silhouette with luscious white hair, four shining eyes, and a warm smile. The chess board waited between them both.

"We welcome you the Unbound, where dreams and reality coexist. Call me Hazy." She carefully spoke, as if each of her words pierced his soul in some way. Two other black silhouettes stood around Hazy, much smaller than her. "We are the Inka, divine beings which are neither angels or demons. We were born to fix mistakes, the little problems within strings that could force the worlds to lose their color and go monochrome. The little problems within the strings that cannot be fixed by the grander beings. That's what we were destined to do, yet, we wonder, why we were made to be so human?"

"Why... Am I here?" Lars' tone was more worried, he felt like all the energy had left his body already.

"You're one interesting character, Lars." Hazy slightly raised her hand, a card appeared between her fingers. She read the card to make sure of something, "One interesting guest..."

Lars tried to look around, but only his mind could move.

"You may be panicked, but do not worry. Most guests do not take their first visit easy. Ease your thoughts, then you may move and be free in this world." She spoke in an oddly comforting way.

Mentally, Lars took deep breaths and suddenly, his hands could move.

"Perfect, you don't seem to struggle internally as much." She smiled, "This chess board between us will define your fate, the outcome of this one round will read your future. The black side, the unforgiving reality, and the white side, the culmination of all your choices you make. Do you know how to play chess?"

"No." Lars felt more at ease. He shook his head.

"With each generation that comes in the developed civilizations, the more people forget to play an ancient game such as chess. It is only understandable, let me teach you." She nodded, her fingers loomed over her chess pieces, the black side.

"The pawns. May only march forward without option, but great potential resides within each of them."

"The bishops. Incredible marksmen, but usually reliant on others to achieve great feats, especially their twin."

"The knights. Unpredictable wildcards, a smart strategy with them may alter your fate."

"The rooks. Obedient and powerful. Their moves are capable of bringing in a slow closure."

"The queen. The most powerful of all."

"And at last, the king. The most important of all, his end will bring in the end of everything."

With each piece she talked about, she also explained how they worked on the board in detail. "Do you understand it now?"

Lars nodded.

"Think carefully of each move, you are not limited by time in this realm."

And so, Lars with trembling hands made his first move. Hazy's strategy was random but harsh, playing in the role of the unforgiving reality. Some moves took a long while to decide for Lars, Hazy's were almost instant. Despite this being Lars' first game of chess in his whole life, the board ended mostly empty. Lars had two knights and a king remaining, Hazy had a queen and the king left.

"Oh!" Hazy was surprisingly ecstatic, "Oh my! How exciting!"

The knights were around the middle of the board, as well as the queen. An uneasy confrontation. Lars carefully thought about any strategies to take out her queen. With even more moves, Lars managed to pin the queen in a fork.

"Oh!" Hazy clapped her hands, "I forfeit!" She tipped over her king.

Lars couldn't help but smile, he had just beaten reality after all.

"Your story will be something even grander than I thought." She rest her chin on her hands, elbows on the board, "This match was truly something else... Your decisions may affect even the upcoming prophecy, Lars."

"What does it truly mean? What will happen in my world?" He was concerned.

"By law, I cannot say." She shook her head, "But the most I can tell you..."

Lars listened carefully.

"...give Houston lots of hugs."

And suddenly the alarm clock rang in the real world, waking Lars up instantly as Houston opened their eyes slower. He was breathing heavily, covered in cold sweat.

"...Are you okay..?" Houston asked in a really drowsy voice.

"Uh, yeah, I am." He took deep breaths, "Just... Had a strange dream."

"What was it?" Curiosity got ahold of Houston.

"It was..." Their alarm rang again, this time from their phones. Rose commanded the team to get to him immediately, this expedition was apparently announced to the public as a part of the gauntlet ceremony. And of course, the whole city is waiting outside to cheer them on.
