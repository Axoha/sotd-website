The Inka's cathedral was a beautiful structure that never seemed to end, adored with tough colorless bricks built by unknown hands. It was incredibly lively within, all the Inka were working on something in their own language. One word, 'Prophecy', stuck out to Houston and Lars as they walked among the countless preparations and choirs. Fenka hummed a familiar tone as she skipped towards the special room, all the Inka they passed by stared at them.

"What are we doing here again?" Houston scuttled towards Lars, nervously but silently asking.

He was in deep thought, mostly looking down with a finger on his chin.

"Oh. Oh!" Fenka turned around, "I must mention, no speaking of this allowed! Everything you see is a work in progress, my living ancestors are hard at work and they would hate seeing their written drafts be revealed to the world!"

"So we don't need to do anything, great, let's-" Houston was already ready to turn around.

"Let's see it!" Lars forcibly smiled as he tugged Houston back from walking away.

"Take this as an act of kindness! You, Lars, you already know about the Inka, I believe you must be special children." She was looping back to her previous words.

And they continued to walk through the decorated monochrome hallways of the cathedral.

"Do you know anything about Hazy?" Lars asked, sparking up a conversation ease the fear of the unknown.

"Hazy?" Fenka tilted her head, "She's old."

"*Is that really all she had to say.*" Lars thought in his mind, but didn't ask anymore questions.

"We're here! The walls of the upcoming prophecay!!!" She gestured with open arms and a huge smile.

"You mean prophecy?" Houston rudely corrected her.

"Yes, yes, yes." She frantically nodded her head, "I love the prophecay, I love it. So sad, so dramatic, ancestors claim they didn't even write the original draft! Makes total sense considering the story of how we came to be, anyway."

She left both of them confused, "What?"

"Okay, I should mention..." She took a deep breath, "What you are about to see is the second prophecy of black and white, the first is how we came to be!" She talked, expecting them to understand and know about everything. Houston and Lars just went along with it.

"And, right after these doors, the ancestors put-"

"What are you doing?" A taller Inka appeared, interrupting Fenka, "Who are these people?" Their six eyes darted towards them.

"I... Um..." She shook her hands, nervously stammering, "I..."

"You know when uninvited people appear you are supposed to escort them out safely and make sure they forget everything!" They raised a finger, "You cannot reveal yourself! One of the most basic rules. Now go, let me fix this problem."

"But I want to show them the upcoming prophecay we have been making!" She looked up, the opposing Inka was far taller than the two. "Please???"

But the Inka only reached her arm out to the right side and pointed towards that direction. Fenka, upset, walked away looking down with a heart-breaking frown, "Bye bye special children..."

Houston and Lars were both confused and intimidated. The Inka looked down at them. "My sincere apologies children... Your presence here is incredibly dangerous to us."

"Hey, hey, what do you mean?!" Houston's stress got to them, "What's going on here in the first place!? We didn't ask to fall down here!"

"Lower your voice please, in such sacred place." She shushed them with a long finger, "This world in the cosmos was engineered to be invisible, but you came here of your own volition. You must forget and never return here, ever."

"We were sent here to get more information on a golden gauntlet that was found in our home, the New Babylon. We don't mean to cause any trouble!" Lars informed and argued.

"Your nosy nature should have disregarded that request. That Babylon is always like that, they never change." She shook her head. "Now, allow my touch. You will wake in your beds without any memory." Her hands lit bright with a white glow.

Houston immediately backed, "No way!!! What about my cat?! What about-"

At that moment, loud crashing could be heard from beneath the walls. The Inka stopped to hear, and in that instant Bill crashed through the wall from the right with his fist ready to throw hands. In a swift move he charged his bio-mechanical fist and threw a devastating punch directly at the Inka with no remorse, but she managed to block such force with just her hand. Warnie rushed up to Houston and Lars and covered them from the Inka.

"Not only..." She struggled against Bill's force, "Do you come... Uninvited. You come here... ARMED!" She was clearly frustrated.

"Whoa whoa what the hell!? Why?!" Lars was hating the current situation as Warnie forced him and Houston to run off to the entrance they arrived in.

"▲ ▲ ▲‼‼" Warnie signaled, threat imminent.

"Don't let it go to waste!" Houston responded, "The information about the gauntlet are just past that door!"

Warnie instantly stopped in her tracks. Bill was still having trouble with the Inka, and so was she.

"Houston! Why?!" Lars started to argue, "We are not supposed to be here, we should leave!"

"Well that ain't our mission order is it?! One more second with these divine freaks and I'll lose it!"

"That's not..." Lars was slightly saddened seeing Houston like that. Fenka was watching from afar, heartbroken.

The Inka that Bill was fighting decided to vanish. "So, what's up?" He got up and asked.

"░" Warnie pointed at a special door.

"That? Sure, let's get it." Bill wiped the sweat off of his forehead. "These shadows got hands."

He busted the door open and absolute darkness was what awaited them. The whole squad decided to step in, slowly. Lars was last, but after looking back at the hallway and seeing Fenka still lurking, he stopped and trailed off to a different path than the team.

"So..." Bill sparked up a conversation in the dark as the doors closed behind them, "What are we supposed to be seeing here?"

"Some 'Inka' mentioned walls of texts. I dunno." Houston replied, their voice echoed throughout the empty space.

Suddenly, texts in white appeared before them,

*THE TALE IN THE HANDS OF THOSE BANISHED.*
*THE FORETELLING OF THE INKA, THE SECOND STORY OF BLACK & WHITE.*

"D-Don't come near me!" Fenka yelped at Lars.

"I don't mean any harm." He tried to move slowly.

"Why aren't you listening to me!" Her grip on a personal small plush toy got more tense, "Leave!"

"I..." Lars thought, feeling guilty, "I just wanted to ask where the nearest exit is, I don't want my team causing more trouble."

"The guardians will come to eviscerate you all, there is no turning back now." She coldly told him.

"I didn't mean for anything like this to happen..." He softly explained it to her, "Like, I don't even care about the gauntlet, never did, I'm just following a contract and the orders my boss gives me."

Fenka started to understand, despite still being fearful, "Okay, I believe your friends should still be eviscerated. You are on my good side."

"Please don't." He looked at her with concerned eyes, "I'm sure they didn't mean what they said and what they did."

*After the botched reconstruction, the Angels and Demons hide in solitude.*
*The Inka who have been sealed away are freed, taking part of the role for which the creators have failed.*
*With bells chiming, a new time coming, the birth of the second sacred child is fast approaching.*

*Two lovers, the King and the Queen.*
*The King will come to rise alongside the Queen, the previous sacred child.*
*But lo, such feat is not achieved, the Queen disappears and the King is left to be.*

*The spirits from a time long gone guide the King. In a place of shadow, the divine trio are united.*

*The VESSEL, a substitute for LOVE. Named King by the Inka, an naïve soldier blindly following the hands of fate.*
*The embodiment of HOPE, referred to as the Knight. A survivor who rejects the harshness of the worlds, carving their own path despite any and all difficulty.*
*And at last... the Jester. Born to ensure the prophecy's order and keep the rest far from the truth.*

*They will meet the darkness, covering each other's side.*
*They will fight the Warrior, named the strongest Guardian of them all.*
*They will confront the Queen together, the first monochrome world destroyed.*
*They will chase the beast of screens at the edge of the cosmos, the second monochrome world destroyed.*
*They will encounter the Rook, a false manifestation of the Inka. Their journey put to a halt, the trio divided...*

"Are... Are you getting all this?" Houston turned to Warnie, worried.

"◘☼" Warnie issued she was currently recording. Even more white texts appeared...

In an instant, the pitch-black room turned fully white, flashing the eyes of those within. Just a second later while the team were realizing their senses, a jagged silhouette appeared at the doors' first step holding an abnormally large blade. With a swing, it felt like it split the whole room in two, its presence alone brought a painful and dizzy sense. The team could not speak to one another, they were all distraught by the single guardian.

"III..." Its silhouette opened a mouth and chanted a number.

The moment the team's eyes got better, Houston and Bill looked at each other from different sides of the room, eyeing the door from which they came from. Thanks to the surroundings being ultra-white, the doors' frame was visible.

"II..." It seemingly counted down. Warnie, without saying anything, gestured to attempt a distraction.

"I..." A drop of sweat ran by Houston's face, at the start they would attempt to blitz right into the door.

"0"

In complete silence, Bill and Houston made a run for it as Warnie went on to wrap the guardian with her arms and legs. The guardian swung its blade and in an instant the limbs of all the people in the room were cut off cleanly. Houston fell to the ground first, the guardian walked up to them with its heels clacking on the unrecognizable floor. It looked down at them, its body looked like it was made of bones, but it was hard to tell, as if its body changed its form the more you looked at it. The guardian was ready to swing its blade again, but the door opened and the light of the cathedral came sweeping in. Fenka stood at the center of the frame, the guardian vanished and appeared in front of her. She simply raised her small hand and pointed a finger at the guardian's face.

The friendly jingle played inside Bill's goggles, "Hey hey hey! What's the hold up?! Where's the information? What did you find?!"

"Nothing at all, other than interesting ruins I guess. You'll eye the pictures we're gonna send." Bill put down his equipment within the ship, going through all the media they took in the ruins.

"I thought it was going to be so much scarier than it was." Houston tilted their head, "Like, y'know, encounter something divine for real."

Lars looked at their pet cat, Sweetie, who stared and meowed at him. "Uh, yeah."

"You look ill, what's up?" They were slightly concerned.

"It's nothing." He put on a weak smile, "I guess you're right with all that divine stuff."

"Sure I am glad we didn't encounter anything crazy." Bill continued going through the pictures, slowly sending them one by one to Rose.

At the middle of the chill atmosphere within the ship, Warnie was sat completely unresponsive, shaking. Nobody would notice until they'd be ready to launch the ship again to go back home. Everyone around was confused, but, after some slight nudging she would return to her position and hastily initiate a launch sequence in the terminal. She uploaded a recording to Rose herself without telling Bill who was managing that sort of stuff.

"Uh..." Lars was worried, "I wonder what's up with her."

"Can't wait to leave this unnerving foggy planet." Houston laid back on their seat, hands behind their head.

"Yeah..." Lars was in deep thought.

The ship flew into the skies, above the dense atmosphere, right into space. Warnie set up the timed teleportation sequence and everyone braced for the swift return back home.

"I completely forgot that there are so many people waiting for us at home." Lars returned to his seat.

"Oh my god, you're right..." Houston groaned, "That's gonna be such a slog-"

The whole ship shook. A massive, unidentified ship has just jumped from a distant space to this system right above them. Automatic alarms immediately sound, an identification process was in progress.

**ENCOUNTERED AN ASSAILANT... - SBS-42 "DISOBEDIENT STAR CRUSHER"**

- Scrappy and gigantic.
- Here to steal the golden ship.
- Unlikely to respond to any contact.

"Honey... Let's completely wreck this golden ship together."
