-- REQUEST CONFIRMED --
I AM ON MY WAY, FATHER.

--

Today, I grabbed a piece of paper and thought to write down my recent journey.

Houston is gone. I didn't even get to say any goodbyes, but those are things I'd rather not talk about.

Whatever happened after the storm, the Inkas appeared and held our hands. We were escorted to a glowing gate, which brought us to a desolate wasteland, one that Ally calls home. The walk was slow, sad, we didn't exchange a single word. Masy decided to come with us.

We eventually found Ally's massive personal walker, a rusty RSRC-MVR, hidden well in the ground. With touch-based sensors, her palm was recognized and the whole machine lit up. Once all of us were inside the walker rose up from the ground, shaking a little to get rid of any leftover dirt. The walker, as Ally calls her home 'Big Johny'.

The last time she was here, Emma still lived, her skin wasn't pale. Trailing through the interior it was not easy for her to look at all the past memories. Photos, drawings, scraps were usually pinned on the wall among the posters and corkboards, like walking through a messy museum. Ally led me to what used to be Emma's room, it was scarred. Cuts through the furniture, black ooze... I settled anyway. Her room was right next to Emma's, I walked over to check on her but she only warded me out and played the bouncy game on her phone. The walker's engines were loud as it journeyed through the empty wasteland under the moon. I thought to go to sleep, it was a long day.

We didn't take it easy, both of us were at our lowest. My mind is still being terrorized, and so is likely Ally's. After a few hours the next day she's finally warmed up to me again, and there began the perpetual cycle. I'd take care of her, she'd take care of me. Masy would sometimes cut in as well, she makes us food after all.

Days passed, I don't know how much. The walker moves constantly for us to settle and forage whatever resource we wake up to on the next day. It was just a cycle, plowing through the trash. No raider bothered to come after us thanks to Ally's great reputation around, which also managed to get us some great deals from scrappy stores.

Me and Ally played games, sometimes with Masy. She had a lot of games that she came up with, some were fun, some were really complex, some were boring ("Do nothing and whoever does something loses???"). It was okay, I saw her getting better, but it doesn't compare to how energetic she was before.

Today, I received a phone call. An odd one at that, but something exciting and not exciting occurred. Turns out the Disobedient camp lives! And they were incredibly confused as to where we were at this whole time. Turns out they managed to escape Tartarus with the help of some Resistance fellows and Disobedients. Those Disobedients, I figured that a majority did not agree with our supposed execution. A branch was torn off from the Disobedient, one that believes *we* deserve another chance at completing that god forbidden mission I dread... That little strange thing, Wall, also wants to see me for reasons I don't know. Our location was shared, they'll be coming in anytime, saying that we'll be brought into a mission right away. Apparently a world-shattering conflict is happening... it's Ena, of course it will be her.

In Masy's word, "The Rook is after the Queen".

I guess tomorrow I will be sent on the battlefield again, and I will suffer more, die multiple times. I don't want to think about it, I just want to rest, Ally does too. Duty calls, and with a huge Disobedient chunk with me... I need to move, I'll turn to Ena's side for all I care. Whatever happens to her out there, I'll ensure happens to me too.

I don't know what to write, I'm tired. Masy refuses to go. Ally hesitated but decided to come with me.

I'm scared.
