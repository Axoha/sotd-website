The room immediately turned red, muffled alarms blared in the background. Ferd grabbed the gauntlet and slipped it right onto his right hand, it was heavy, unbearable to wear.

"Haha! Way to go, it'll take 'em a while to get here, show what it can do!" They excitedly yapped.

"Ugh..." He struggled to lift up his arm, "There is a handle bar..."

"You gotta raise your hand into the air, and think of something to manifest into reality!" They went through pages of studies, "Y'know, try your best! Reach into your heart."

With every second that ticked by, it seemed as if if the gauntlet was becoming easier to handle. He listened, he raised his hand into the air and thought of something he cared for... nothing happened, there was only an awkward silence.

"My arm hurts from this." He scoffed as he still had his hand raised, "You should try."

They walked up to him, "Sure, just hand it over..." They grabbed the gauntlet by both hands after Ferd lowered his hand, "Stop holding onto it!"

"I'm not?" He tilted his head, looking at the gauntlet before trying to get it off him as well. It wasn't budging, it was stuck. Both of them made sounds of struggle as they slipped against the floor.

"Dude..." They backed away after giving it all they could, "There must be some sort of mechanism in it, it's sealed-

And the world turned monochrome once more.

"Bwahahaha!!! I can't believe you actually disregarded your whole life for this mission! You must really care for her, too much maybe? That you erase your identity and let yourself be guided mindlessly all around all the time? That was brave, I would never trust a guy like Houston ever!" 

Internal panic struck. Ferd frantically looked around himself, everything was frozen around him, "What is this, what is going on?!"

"You've chosen your fate, it's sealed." Masy appeared, sat right in front of Ferd, "The upcoming prophecy will come to be, I'm just excited!"

"Wh- What are you talking about???" He was scared, his own heartbeat could be heard.

"I cannot say anything..." She shook her head, "But, this was the only path you could've chosen to ever see her again, anyway."

He had no words to say, he was silent, looking down... "What do I do now?" He asked.

"Oh, Ferd, Ferd, Ferd, Ferd, now is the biggest time to make decisions for yourself! Being constantly lead around won't get you far, it's time to adapt!" She laughed, "But, evade the coming strike from right behind you once the lights are back on!"

And from that point, the world felt like it moved and the colors flashed back in. He looked behind him, and the wall that was there seemingly detonated and the whole room was obscured in ash. From within the smoke came a big figure, holding an intimidating pose with clenched fists that steamed. Houston immediately ran up to Ferd and grabbed his hand, leading him to even more hallways.

"Dude! I forgot to tell you about my boss!!!" They yelled out, turning on a device that let them open and close any doors within the museum.

They let go of Ferd, "What's up now?!" He yelled back, as he ran behind them.

"That's Bill, prefers to be called 'Big Bill', he's a menace! A freak! He has been training to be the next wielder of the gauntlet for *years!*"

"Why didn't you tell me that before?!" He was bewildered, "You really have to start telling me all the details, come on man!"

"I thought he'd be on vacation!!!" They yelled back again.

Suddenly, before them opened a shaft in the floor with sliding doors. Houston grabbed his arm again and leapt down into darkness.

*Three minutes earlier.*

"Hey, all that is signed and checked, all of *that* is signed and checked. Anything I'm missing, sir?" In a secluded room, the Citadelarian figure 'Rose' mumbled to himself, partially speaking to someone.

"Hell if I know." Bill groaned while lifting weights, "I'm getting tired of all this nonsense, can't wait to get it over with today."

"Er, yeah." Rose nodded, "It's a tight schedule, but we should be able to commence the gauntlet ceremony sometime in a week. The populations and nations must know, and that takes time! This will change everything as we know it!"

"Yeah, that little demon is getting real tired of me though, she's urging me to take the gauntlet. All this preparation is really pissing her off, me included." He kept on with a grumbly voice.

"That being?! She spoke to you again and you said nothing?!" Rose was bewildered with his single wide open eye. He snatched a notebook and a pen and got ready to write with a click, "What all did she say? We need to know!"

"Ugh, something about..." And the room turned red and the alarms blared.

"Agh!!! What now?! Where is Houston to deal with things like these?! Where are they?!" Rose dropped his pen and notebook and rushed towards a terminal to open up live camera footage. Bill stood up, his massive body creating a shadow over Rose. They both leaned in to look at the screen.

"He's dead." He immediately walked away, slamming the locked door open. Rose had nothing to say, literally.

--

"Okay, it should be somewhere around here..." Houston was looking at the walls with a light, trying to find an exit. After some stumbling around, they succeeded. The sunlight flashed at them with a force that made their eyes squint.

"Huh, knew there would be no one around." They scoffed, brushing dust off of their shoulders, "All we gotta do is get to that tower, easy escape from there!" They pointed a finger towards an odd structure riddled with satellites.

"Is that another gauntlet on your arm." Ferd was confused, he didn't notice until now.

"Yeah, mine's fake-"

All the screens on the skyscrapers and all the speakers everywhere were suddenly tuned into one channel. *BREAKING*, two individuals steal an endorsed relic worth trillions, spotted currently behind the grand museum. Their faces were shown clearly and live through dozens off surveillance systems around. The poles transformed into sentries, lasers appeared at all over their bodies, they were frozen. Houston gave Ferd a side-eye, holding some sort of gadget in their hand.

"You can't be serious." He murmured, shaking his head.

And so they activated it, temporarily disabling all electronics in vicinity which gave them just enough time to run. They immediately took turns into the tight alleyways between buildings, they ran together while Houston was busy rummaging through his bag throwing whatever other handy gadgets they had on hand. Climbing gloves and boots, a grappling hook, hammers. Ferd put on the advanced climbing accessories while stumbling trying to keep up momentum as Houston tore off his dress to reveal they've also been wearing a tuxedo suit beneath, which widened Ferd's eyes. It was clear what to do, he began to scale the skyscraper with them. Their location was tracked at all times, sirens blared in the streets as their building became surrounded.

"We should be *TOTALLY* safer up here!" Houston spoke up once they reached the summit of the building.

Right after that, hovercrafts ascended right besides them with snipers onboard. More laser sights showed up and opened fire, the high-caliber shots echoed throughout the air.

*Meanwhile, at the Disobedient's sanctuary.*

"Vladimir! You need to peep the news!!!" Several allies called out, everyone was huddled at the television this day.

"I cannot believe how many times I need to state that I do not care about that nonsense." He continued his smoke break.

"Ferd-o is there!" A distinct voice came from behind the group.

"Why did you not start with that?!" Annoyed, he threw his cigarette on the floor and put it out with his foot. He slowly made his way to the television screen, and there was the live broadcast of him and Houston on the run, wanted by the entire New Babylon. Some allies cheered for them, others watched with anxiety, Vlad was certainly not happy.

Houston slid and jumped onto another building, their identical gauntlets were perfect, the targets were split. They were getting ever so closer to the great transportation tower, but it was monumental, they had to find a faster way to travel.

"This..." Ferd spoke in ragged breaths, "Sniper..." He gasped, "Would've killed me..." He slid onto another building, "...If I didn't have this curse on my hand!" Right as he finished his sentence, a bullet ricocheted off of the gauntlet again.

Another hovercraft ascended from below the rooftops. The shuttle doors opened and Bill came appeared standing there, the wind perfectly waving his fur with the sunset. His body was now clear in the warm daylight, a cat, with strikingly similar features to Ferd. Houston immediately went onto to act. They grabbed Ferd's arm again and signaled that they'll jump onto a lower floor, breaking the glass with their gauntlets. He gulped, but there was no other choice, he nodded in understanding. They looked at each other before leaping, and in an intense moment they shattered the glass and made a safe landing, with tons of cuts of course.

"The tower is surrounded by the factory district of this region." They quickly spoke, "We must get on a train."

"Is there even-" And more glass shattered nearby at the hallway, it was Bill, he was coming.

"TRAITOR!" His voice was booming and agitated, "YOU WILL *PAY*."

He leapt, on all fours he dashed towards them like a predator to prey. Houston managed to bust down an elevator door into the shaft right after evading Bill's strikes. With the hand that held their gauntlets, fake and real, they could use the elevator wire as rope. Bill was right after them, sticking onto walls, charging his bio-mechanical fists for devastating punches. Holes and cracks were made within the shaft, both of them often had to twirl around the wire while descending at ludicrous speeds. It wasn't long before they eventually hit an elevator full of people, Ferd acted fast and tore off the ceiling of the elevator to leap inside. There were screams, the elevator sustained a lot of damage. Houston leapt in as well and punched the doors with the gauntlet, both of them continued their run. Bill, behind, noticed the situation and took his time to get ahold of the elevator to let the people evacuate before it collapsed.

"There it is." Houston talked out of breath, finally out of Bill's sight, "The track towards the tower, the factory district is flat."

Ferd looked through the window, there were massive walkers with round mountains, the sunset burned behind. It was a surprisingly pleasant sight. "Let's slide, the angle isn't so steep."

"Great mindset." Houston chuckled before breaking the glass besides them to proceed.

Both of them leapt outside together, the building was conveniently designed to not include any obstructions at its angled side. Bill leapt out from the same floor, far behind, he took a flat piece of debris and used it as a surfing board. Ferd looked with wide eyes as Bill surfed on the building, frantically looking for anything on him to use. Houston used their gauntlet to slow down by placing his palm upon the slippery glass, they thought of an idea to potentially disrupt Bill's antics. But, he was a few steps ahead, once he noticed they were getting closer he jumped and grabbed the debris. He threw it like a javelin directly besides Houston, disrupting them rather than him. Ferd noticed the trouble, he slowed down as well to get closer, but it was too late. 

"You're done for." Bill scoffed.

"Nah, you wouldn't-"

Bill dashed towards Houston and grabbed their gauntlet. His grip was far too strong, he punched through a glass wall to grab onto a floor and stop their whole run. He then used his immense strength to toss Houston onto a floor, directly through glass shattering a whole wall. They were terribly bruised, bleeding, Bill's menacing shadow covered him soon obscuring the sunset. He dragged them and leaned them against a wall, sat.

"Can't believe you really think that would work out." He was grumpy.

Houston let go of their fake gauntlet, Bill swiftly took it into his hands, realizing they had a fake this whole time.

"...How does it feel to lose to a weaker variant?" They coughed, using his remaining strength to speak, "Must be sour, haha..."

Ferd finally reached the ground, he looked back at the broken windows of the building, but there wasn't any time to waste. He proceeded alone, running to board a train in a surprisingly calm resolution. Fortunately, the part of the train he boarded was empty. He collapsed on the seats, exhausted. No time for rest, the backdoors of the car were torn off by Bill's own hands. He immediately leapt onto Ferd like a wild animal, pinning him against the cold, plated floor.

"I don't understand why you chose to do this!" He began conversing, "What is the big goal!? What is your selfish desire!?" His grip on him tightened.

Ferd tried to fight back, but he was too strong. There were noises of struggle.

"Do you even realize what that gauntlet is capable of!?" He yelled directly into his face, "A figure like you, should NEVER wield such thing! I was born to be the Babylon's hero, I trained my whole life for it, I respected it, and YOU come out of nowhere to tear the Babylon of a hopeful future!"

It was futile, he stopped, letting himself be in the hands of Bill.

"There is no other choice but to tear that arm from your body..." He scoffed, He leaned his mouth to his ear. "...And I'll enjoy that, *truly*."

He felt chills, his fur stood up at its peak. There was no one around to help him, not a soul to come and save him. He had no choice but to look up at the ceiling, a light, which had slowly turned into Masy to watch him in his torment. 

As Bill got a proper grip of his right arm...

He felt the senses of touch, someone patting him on his head, someone holding his shoulder. An individual with long hair, a torn jacket, there were fuzzy memories that played out within his mind. He thought back to his family, his mother who had adopted and cared for him his whole life. He thought back to...

Ferd grabbed Bill's hand with the gauntlet and tossed him aside. What sudden change, Ferd looked at his body, his palms, his feet.

"You were holding back, weren't you?" Bill smirked, "Not a pathetic worm after all!?"

"No." Ferd calmly looked back at Bill, "I'd advise you step back, this will hurt."

"You piss me off to no end, Ferd." He cracked his knuckles, "Just accept your fate!"

Bill began to throw punches, Ferd took some, but he was still standing. He evaded and punched back with surprising strength, but his body was still no match.

"Boxing... wasn't exactly my strong suit." He talked as he fought, "The decades of military training really paid off."

"Are you making a joke out of me?!" He replied with an offended tone, "Go back to being a punching bag!"

Bill charged up his fist for a great punch, and so did Ferd. Their fists clashed, Bill's knuckles bled and Ferd's gauntlet was left with a dent.

"I fought a guy like you, not for long, but I suppose it still counts." He managed to land punches, recoiling Bill slightly.

"I'm sick." Bill dashed and grabbed his face, slamming his head against a wall. "It's over!" There was a hint of despair in his voice, he grabbed Ferd's arm and...

Ferd reacted in a way, in the blink of an eye he charged up the gauntlet and landed a punch that blew a hole in his stomach. Bill was speechless, he hovered his hand above the gaping hole in his body and collapsed onto the floor. Blood was splattered everywhere. Ferd looked at the palm of the bloody gauntlet, then outside the window for the tower, the sun was gone.
