She stood and waited, facing the thrones. The checkered floor reflected the waterfalls of light surrounding the whole throne room.

*Honey.*

She turned to Ferd. She was not a monstrous being anymore.

*It has finally come to this, after so many months.*
*I was hoping, begging, trying to change the course of the prophecy, but alas the unfinished tale remains.*

She held both of her hands to her own chest.

*I was always there, with you in the shadows.*
*I've seen you fight.*
*I've seen you feel.*
*You faced each trial, carefully, recklessly. You triumphed over each challenge.*

Her hands slowly drift apart, extending her left arm to her far side.

*We both know what is coming, honey.*
*If our tale doesn't go as told, everything will break apart.*

*…*

*Just know, Ferd, I have never stopped loving you.*

Her left arm covered itself with black ooze, which slowly shift into a gauntlet identical to Ferd's. The white symbols shined on its dark cover, a large glowing trident was manifested into existence right into her hand. The Queen's skull covered her face, and wings reminiscent of a bat grew from her back. Her form melted into one unstable shadow, a silhouette that is dizzy to look at. Ferd knew there was nothing to say back.

With quick dashes and lunges, the Queen begun her offensive. The King, still unused to the Gauntlet used his right arm for cover. He evaded each strike, just barely. They both moved along the checkered floor, the constant defense and offense had turned into one final dance. Again, and again, the trident had struck and cracked the floor, then retrieved. Again, and again, Ferd takes steps back and to the sides. Again, and again, the Queen strikes his gauntlet. Again, and again, the King and the Queen hide their tears. There was no exhaustion, only an empty, hollow feeling, a countdown towards the inevitable. All it took from the King was one good offensive move with the Gauntlet. Silence, complete silence.

"How is school beating your ass so far?"

"Wonderfully."

"That's awesome, same here!"

"Do you want to eat my homework? I don't want to do it."

"F-Ferd?! You're giving me this wonderful opportunity again?! Hell yeah dude."

"Do you want a sauce packet with it again?"

"Absolutely you think I'm just gonna eat raw paper???"

*2012 - 20A 07/16*

"Hey this view's pretty nice, don't you think?"

"It's boring."

"Really?! We're this high up in the sky and you think this beautiful sight of our hometown sucks?!"

"Oh, Ferdi, I'm kidding! Of course it's beautiful! Y'know, I can feel my eyes burning from staring at the sunset."

"*Don't do that...*"

...

"...Y'know, it does need some more action though. Ferris wheels are sloooow."

"Don't you dare rock this cabin again."

"Let me just position myself here for maximum efficiency, hell yes."

"Don't do this!! Getting on here was already terrifying!-"

*2014 - 20A 5/30*

"I'm nervous about tomorrow."

"Oh, honey, what makes you feel that way?"

"Sweetie, we're enlisting in the military."

"What, are you not excited?"

"It's just... It feels *dangerous*, y'know? A part of me just wants to stay and settle, find another job, we could work together?"

"We tried, remember? Why not give this a try?"

"But, Ena-"

"It'll all be fine."

*2763 (2019 - 20A) - 12/6*

"Yo, honey, check out this award I received! Which one did you get?"

"Um, let me see..."

"*Most reckless soldier on the battlefield, Mark four?* That's a bum ass badge, come on! We'll try for another one together!"

--

*2765 (2021 - 20A) - 1/27*

"We're never growing up from this awfully constructed song, are we?"

"No, never... Maybe you could turn it into some sort of real song, since our retirement is so close already?"

"Yeah... Tomorrow, I'll try to get things sorted out with the leader. I'm kinda worried if I'm being honest."

"Can't imagine it's gonna be too bad... I do wonder how the reactions gonna be, though."

--

Butterflies, cats, bears. Sunsets, cliffs, seas. Songs, joy, peace. Family, friends, love. As their battle went on, their bodies melted. Their movements grew slower, the same repeated noise. Eventually, Ena gave in, she dropped on her knees as her trident tumbled away. She covered her mouth, face, and squealed. Ferd would also drop besides her. No progress was made, none of them had enough courage to kill one another.

"I can't!" He shook, holding his head.

There was nothing to say, they just looked at each other. Holding each others' hand as they slowly melted, the world cracked like glass. They understood they could never fulfill the act, and to defy the tale, they hugged. Letting their emotion out to their partner's shoulder, in silence. The world cracked more, until eventually, it all shattered. Nothing remained, just the endless expanse of the dark. Nothing remained. Nothing. The Queen disappeared, the King turned unconscious. And that nothing, it was coming to swallow the King as a whole. As all matter dusted away, as all history began to vanish, Masy watched in despair. This could not be how it all ends, no, this could not be. Everyone's lives, everyone's love, existence, nature, the meaning, she could not watch. If the Queen won't die, then, everyone will vanish. She ran into the flickering waterfall of light, past by it she ran across the checkered floor. She looked up to the throne, placing her palm on the arm, creating a blinding light that obscured it all.

*"No matter what it takes, disregard your duty. Break it all so I can see him again."*

*The Queen's line rings out in my head.*
*For my whole life, I was scared.*
*Not anymore, no.*
*I will face my fears.*
*And I will fix my mistakes, for good.*

Pages of literature scattered in the winds, falling through the howling void. The darkness took form of itself, turning into the beast, the Queen's form that could not be defined. The King fell through the void, given up, hollow. The Queen looked at him with two dotted glowing eyes, the shattered fragments cracked even more. A distant roar came from a distance, and again, a serpentine dragon flew through the emptiness. It's frame skinny, a silhouette, paired with long and thick glowing white hair and multiple contrasting eyes. It snatched the King from the sight of the Queen, now a beastly giant in a world of nothing. A world of white.

"...Ferd..." The dragon spoke to him as he was holding onto its snout, "...Ferd!"

"Why..." Lacking energy, he responded.

"Everything is going to end, including you both!" The dragon spoke through the mind, not opening its mouth even just a bit, "The Queen cannot defy her own fate! Her body will only revolt to force it happen! Stronger, scarier, uncontrollable, it's not her anymore!"

"W-Who are you?" He crawled to its hair.

"I'm Masy, promoted." Her eyes darted back to him, "We're ending this. I'm not letting the world end, I will fulfill the wish I was born from!"

She flew, along with Ferd on her head, to confront the Queen properly. The King and the dragon against the whole world. One more time, he was willing to try.

"You'll have to dive onto the Queen for me. One shining spot at a time, we'll be taking in a procedure that will force her mind to open." She flew high above the Queen.

The King looked to her eyes, and then his own gauntlet. "It'll hurt her, won't it?"

"Her form is lost! It won't hurt her! Trust me on all I say, we're fixing this." In a dive, she threw Ferd off her snout to force him into the air. Ferd manifested wings to fly, and soon he'd catch up to be alongside Masy.

"There, the spots. Neck, shoulder, nose." She pointed with her long snout, "Create a spear, trident, needle, anything to pierce those zones!"

The Queen roared, knitting strings with fingers, creating a beam of dark matter which tore the void like paper. A gaping wound of darkness seeped in, more devastating beams were to come. Harshly landing on her rightmost shoulder, Ferd hesitantly forged a weapon in his hand.

"I'm going to kill her." He thought to himself, holding the weapon right above her skin.

"No! I have... I have a plan!!!" Masy quickly replied to his mind, flying right below the Queen's hand. Creating strings from its eight limbs, each weighing four fingers to intercept the upcoming beams, delaying the inevitable destruction of the last remaining fabric of life.

"It won't hurt her, it won't..." He told himself right before stabbing the Queen's shoulder with a trident. The Queen flinched, cried in pain, her mask cracked.

"Two more! The neck and the nose!" Masy swam through the chaos.

Ferd leapt through the Queen's jagged skin, reaching her neck. He did not think, he created another trident to pierce her neck. The mask was on the brink of collapsing, tears streamed beneath. The more time they spent here, the more abstract everything has gotten. Nothing made sense anymore, they needed to hurry.

"Get on me!" Masy roars out from a far distance. "The nose!"

Ferd jumps from the Queen's colossal body right onto Masy's snout. Cracks, wounds, darkness, the void itself crumbled. The Queen's form grew more unstable each passing second. The dragon, Masy, flew above the Queen's head.

"All you need to do, Ferd. Dive onto her nose, land the final strike!" She urgently ordered.

"But, what then?" He turned to her eyes and asked.

"You'll see her again, I promise." She said, as strings enveloped her limbs.

Ferd was hesitant, but as the Queen continued to destroy existence, he brought himself to courage and dove down onto her. He charged his gauntlet as he fell, with Masy following right behind.

"Ferd... I'm happy to have served you well."

"Masy?!"

The gauntlet hits the nose, the mask shatters, all light disappears. The Queen's mind tears open, gravity ceases to exist. Masy dives into the Queen's mind, the core, and with the strings of creation enveloped on her limbs, all explodes into clusters of galaxies, black holes, nebulas, stars, planets, moons, and love. 

Everything turns to white, at peace.
