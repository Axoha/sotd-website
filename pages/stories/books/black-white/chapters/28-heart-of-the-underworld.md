"So that's what I was missing..." Bill scratched their chin, "I was never supposed to wield the gauntlet, great. Why bother putting so much resources on me then? What was I made for?"

"Well, the whole prophecy is composed of odd consequences one after another, hm?" Rose turned to him, "Ferd may have never arrived, it's important to take every step of the future with a grain of salt."

"So the 'New Age' project... it's completely scrapped now right? What do I do now?" Bill began to question himself.

"Boss." Rose jokingly poked at them, "You shouldn't be taking orders from your colleagues anymore, you're free to do as you please."

"Right, okay." He looked down, "I suppose it's time to go back to my regular life, huh?"

"Exactly." He clicked his pen, "I advise you to talk with Ferdinand. Accustom him to the Babylonian life, become friends."

--

Somewhere, at the far edge of space, the trio were booted off a golden ship on an unknown monochrome planet fit with gear during the middle of the night. The ship flew off without a word, and the mission finally commenced.

Houston approached Ferd, "You need help with-"

"No, I'm good." He stretched and yawned, "I want to sleep."

Houston was pleasantly surprised at seeing him act normal, but Ally smiled, she knew he was making steady progress.

"What?" Ferd raised an eyebrow looking at them both, "I'm good, I was worse when I went through my first mission years ago!"

"Alright, let's get a move on." Houston shut their mouth and gestured, readying a cable near the hole to get down into the underworld safely. Once the line was ready, they scuttled to Ally and quietly asked, "How is he doing fine? Just yesterday he was completely wrecked."

Ally moved her head closer to theirs, "He woke up like that today, he's just feeling better." She said, shrugging.

Ferd clumsily attached their suit to the line whilst they both watched from afar. Once it was connected, Ferd slipped and fell down into the abyss.

"How much sleep did he get?" They looked at Ally with a concerned face.

"A bunch." She bluntly replied.

Soon they'd attach themselves to the line and descend into the underworld. The flying serpentines appeared once more, the darkness growing within their presence. Ferd was politely sat on the thick fragile snow, waiting for the two to finally arrive. Once they dropped down, they picked him up and ventured into the darkness.

"Ally..." He fidgeted with his fingers, "If you don't mind, could you make me one of those little squishy things in some sort of net that really help out?

"Absolutely!" She nodded, clasping her hands together create black ooze from which the anti-stress ball forms from. With a simple toss, she gently throws it into his hand.

"Thanks." He squished the ball, looking at it satisfied and calm.

"I often forget you can just... do that." Houston was weirded out, "It's been like what, a week or two and you already mastered it."

"It's fun." She smiled, "Very convenient."

Suddenly, she felt something poke her shoulder. As usual, Ferd, "Hey, I wanted to show off something."

Houston and Ally stopped in their tracks, with Ferd taking a few steps back. "I don't like the gauntlet, but from whatever happened, I learned something to do with it."

Houston was overjoyed, "You can fabricate things?!"

Ferd's gauntlet shined, and in the next few seconds he floated in the air, slowly rising up. "No I can swim." He replied, unaffected by gravity.

Houston was disappointed.

"Oh, oh! Can you fly and have like these awesome wings?" Ally on the other hand, was excited.

"No, I can only swim!" He continued replying, high up in the air. He swam back to the ground, and upon touching the floor his body was suddenly affected by gravity.

"It's a start." Houston shook their head smugly, "Let's continue, we're close." They spoke looking at their watch.

"Where are we going anyway?" Ally looked around, helping Ferd to get back up on his legs.

The time on Houston's watch hit 6:00 MM, and from the darkness rose a sound. A bell rang in the distance, and more bells would come to add onto the initial tone. The intense but calm song lightened the underworld, several Inkas popping out of the snow to look at the general direction of the noise. The darkness cleared a way, a massive cathedral linked between the two worlds, ground and ceiling, ominously stood at the front of the trio. There was no telling how big it actually was, the cathedral spread out to the horizon of this world. The cathedral held no cracks, no signs of damage, everything was kept pristinely clean. The leviathans slowly swam up to the cathedral's bells, gently and slowly stopping the noise. The Inkas from all around the underworld walked to the cathedral - three of them stopped by Ferd, smiling with curiosity and intrigue. Ally was in complete and utter awe, but Houston stood with crossed arms smiling.

"That's the sacred palace." They looked to her, "The heart and the home to all the Inka."

Unusually, none of the Inkas were scared of the gauntlet. Instead, they touched it, and eventually the three of them near would hold him by his hand and guide him to the grand entrance. Ally and Houston followed, curious. The Inkas walked with their little feet plowing through the snow, the entrance heavily guarded by the sacred guardians. Their forms changing, inconsistent, but their presence peaceful.

"What is going on?" Ferd calmly asked, leaning down to match the height of an Inka as they walked.

"Your majesty, you've proven yourself as the King." One of the Inkas holding his index finger spoke, "After the Monarch's entry, the Queen has established a new order to treat you with the utmost care along with the two other mortals you deeply care about. You are no longer a survivor of coincidences, and your two companions are no longer our assumed foes."

He was surprised, but a reoccurring thought came into his mind, "Is the Queen here?" He asked, saving all other questions for later.

"We do not know where the Queen is. You are not asking to come end the prophecy, hopefully?" She turned back, a concerned simple face looked at him.

"No! No no no! No way!" He frantically shook his head.

The trio, alongside the Inkas have finally reached the entrance. A colossal gate embedded in a concrete wall of stained windows among the hundreds of beautiful carvings. "Here, we must depart. It was a joy to serve the majesty."

A farewell was made, and the three Inkas walked into the gate and disappeared in the shadows. The hallway inside was nothing but darkness, the trio had no other choice but to step in as the Guardians watched with amuse. Ferd went first, feeling the shadows with the gauntlet before assimilating with the darkness. Ally followed after, concerned but brave, willing to give in. Houston went last, unbothered, experienced. After a moment of wandering around in nothingness, the first tiles of the floor appeared beneath their feet, and soon the whole interior of the palace would open itself up. Stairs leading anywhere into any room, detailed paintings hung with dazzling frames, a spacious entrance with a reflective checkered floor of black and white. Inkas walked on the ceiling, carrying objects, fixing cracks. Everyone was busy, but the trio in awe.

"This is the part where we figure the written prophecy, right?" Ally directly asked Houston.

"Precisely." They nodded.

"It wouldn't hurt to roam around for a bit, would it?" Ferd bluntly spoke, looking at the ceiling and all the possible details around.

"Nah." Houston scratched their nails, "We can totally do something like that if you please."

"I wanna go there! I wanna look at those paintings! That room looks so wonderful?!" Ally was out of control. She led the rest of the group wherever she wanted, grabbing their arms and running on the fancy white carpet. They visited the dining rooms, the praying rooms, the little museums, studio rooms, creation rooms. The Inkas happily served them and offered answers. they were starting to get a little dizzy, running from stairs, gravity constantly changing. Sometimes they ran upside down without noticing, everything felt like an optical illusion.

It all came to a silence once they reached a strange room. An empty, dark room, with walls full of paintings framed in an orderly manner. The tables were dusty, the candles unusually unlit. The trio's feel shifted from curiosity and wonder to just intrigue. A statue made of marble loomed at the back, a statue of a grand abstracted couple surrounded by tiny Inkas. Ferd put on his glasses to read the text carved at the bottom.

"The Angel and the Demon. Together bound by love, in an unfinished tale without an end."

"We're getting somewhere." Houston whistled, looking at the portraits painted on the framed paintings. "Totally haven't seen this before."

"This statue..." Ally spoke with her heart, "Man, I can't help but feel... sad, by just looking at it."

Ferd listened, but his focus was more on the portrait behind the statue which was obscured by thick curtains. With a gentle push, he unsheathed the curtains and the portrait was fully revealed. A young Ena Lone, probably painted when she was four years old. The text below the frame only read, "ENA, the first sacred child." Houston and Ally came to take a closer look as well, Ferd was in shock.

"She was adopted by the Lone family." He muttered to himself, "I suppose that makes the most sense after everything..."

"She looks so goofy and joyous in that picture." Ally tilted her head, "What's the deal with that right eye, though?"

"Her right eye was always a mystery we liked to chatter about." He chuckled, "Just a severe birthmark we always thought, always hidden behind her fluffy and thick gray hair. It was always a part of something much bigger, now I know." He looked at the painted marks on both her right eye and his own gauntlet, some of the symbols matching.

"Hey, at least you both are kinda matching now!" She smiled, "That's gonna make for a good talk once everything settles, screwed up right eyes."

He awkwardly chuckled back, "Sure."

Ferd's eye glanced over another portrait further away. A modest, elegant woman with a right eyepatch and a tall neck was painted on it. Gothic makeup was a huge part of her character, paired with the boney fingers and slim features. "RILA" A text below the frame was written. Ferd looked at it for a long while.

"What'cha looking at?" She walked to Ferd again.

"She looks like my mom, she's not that dull though." He reached out to his pocket to take out his wallet, where he had an old scratched picture of little him and his mom on a vacation. "Do you see the resemblance?"

"Hmmm..." She thought out loud, "Nope, not really, maybe?"

"I guess that sets the final answer." He shrugged it off, putting his wallet away. Ally couldn't help but notice he kept the paper Masy in his wallet neatly folded.

"Yo, Houston." Ferd and Ally called out, "We think we're done going through this room."

"Damn, about time." They sounded a little tired, "I figured the place where the prophecy is written, let's go there."

And they set off, leaving the dark and dusty room to its peace once more. They trailed the long hallways, Inkas occasionally passing by. A choir was heard somewhere nearby, Ferd couldn't resist the curiosity and opened the nearby doors from where the beautiful melody was seemingly coming from. With a gentle push, their eyes were met with a pitch black room lit by a single spotlight aimed at a group of Inkas singing their hearts out. A giant Inka with long silky white hair lead the notes that should be sang, like a grand teacher. An Inka on the far right of the crowd noticed the slightly opened door, it was Masy, stopping her beautiful singing to smile and wave at the trio who were sneakily looking. With unintelligible and unheard speech, she called herself off to leave the crowd and come to the trio. She proceeded to tackle Ferd with a tight hug.

"Oh, Ferd, I missed you!" She nuzzled, "I've heard what happened! I'm so sorry..."

"It's okay..." He gently brushed her hair.

"What have you three been up to here?" She looked at the rest of the group, curious.

"Just looking for the prophecy." Ally spoke up, "Also having fun at the cathedral, the Inkas are so nice!"

"Oh, the prophecy?" She tilted her head, "Be more specific?"

"A room, with the whole tale written on the walls?" Houston asked, "I mean, I know where it is, but-"

"That's not a thing anymore." She shook her head, "It's been replaced by what I think is something far better. Follow me."

Houston raised an eyebrow, but the other two were willing to follow. Masy found her way onto Ferd's back, and before he knew it he was giving her a piggyback ride. The trio, now with Masy, walked through the hallways talking about nonsense.

"Man I kinda wanna be on Ferd's shoulders like that." Ally and Houston both quietly thought to themselves.

"It wasn't easy convincing all my sisters and brothers to like you two." She blabbered on about something, "I'm super glad that everything's worked out, so much respect goes on here now!"

They continued to walk, until suddenly Masy told them all to stop. The hallway was dark, illuminated by just small white fire and glowing butterflies.

"The stairs to your right, up there will be everything that needs to be known." Masy's voice turned more intriguing.

"Where'd your backpack go?" Ally questioned Houston, "You were carrying like these crazy things, what happened to it?"

"Put it down at the entrance, it was heavy." They crossed their arms, "Nothing's gonna happen to it, I hope so."

The group walked into another pitch-black room with only dimly lit stairs. They ascended the path, Ferd looked back at Ally who didn't seem so scared of the absence of light anymore. Reaching the top, a small pool of water within a large bowl stood. A window with stained glass shined at the back of the darkness.

"Soak your hand, and the answers will come to be."
