Masy looked at Houston with fear. She took small steps back, before running away without a word. Ferd was on the floor from the impact, Ally stood across Houston with trembling hands. Silence, no Inka came around, no Guardian interrupted, just silence.

"None of this was meant to happen." Houston opened up, shaking their head looking down, "None of this." They looked at Ally with a genuine expression.

She slowly walked, and then ran, grabbing onto Houston to tackle them off the ledge of the Cathedral. They were both in the air, falling down, Ally's grip was painful and powerful.

"You monster!" She cried out, "You knew what was going on! Why would you kill her!?"

"The world would end if I didn't!" Aggressively replying, they constantly tried to kick Ally off of them. "The Inka are not meant to-"

They both crashed through a roof of stained glass. Tumbling through the dark room below littered with monochrome glass shard, both of them swiftly got up with their injuries stitching themselves.

"What more are you hiding?!" She desperate yelled through a sore voice.

"There's no point in hiding anymore." They grumbled, holding their right eye, bleeding black. Their body shook, legs trembling, hands shaking. "I was here to ensure the prophecy goes the right way... I am the Babylon's agent, the sniper! Are you happy now?!"

"N-No...!" With deep, inconsistent breath, Ally couldn't comprehend such words. All those memories and all the times shared together meant nothing now. Her hands darkened, she shook. With an emotional outburst she leapt at Houston, reckless with the full intention of tearing them apart with her hands. Houston defended themselves, forming a black dagger in their hand to directly stab through Ally's palm. With their other hand they held Ally back, close, face to face.

"Now, leave me." Houston spoke with a serious tone, "It's over, my part is done."

"L-Like the hell am I gonna leave you!" She stuttered, struggling to push her hand through the dagger, "I knew it! I never should've trusted you! I hate you! I hate you!" Streams of tears ran through her cheeks.

Those words hit Houston, but they weren't letting themselves fall. With a strong kick she fell back on the floor, there was a spotlight at the center of the room with none of them in it.

"One and zero, score for me!"

A sunny day after a storm, the world covered in thick snow. Little Houston stood above young Ally, holding a perfectly round snowball in their hand. 

"Come on, don't be so dramatic! Let's get you back up." They reached out their hand to help her stand up.

Back in the lit, dark empty room, Houston dug their hand into their pocket to take out a gadget. With a simple press of a button they'd open a white shining gate to go through. As they took their first step, black wire grabbed onto their shoulders from behind. Looking back, Ally was standing, her limbs mutated. Her hands were nothing but wire, excreting black ooze.

Young Ally ran up to little Houston to tackle them to the ground. Happily playing around, she tickled them, and they laughed to the point of tears running through their face. They rolled around in the snow, the sunny sky lifting their spirit to no bounds. "Ally!" They giggled, "I don't wanna fight you like this! You aren't ticklish!"

*"I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU!"*

"Oh, really?" She smirked.

Little Houston grabbed a handful of snow to throw at her face. Pushing her away, they got up and caught their breath, they laughed too much. "Ally, I really need to go back home." Their tone turned more genuine.

"What, does it hurt to hang out with me so much?" She playfully teased.

"On second thought... maybe not!" They rolled up a snowball, "Best to three, how's that sound?"

They both crashed through the Cathedral's stained glass, into the underworld. Tumbling over a sloped roof, they were both nothing but unstable amalgamations of darkness. Clawing, punching, tearing each other apart with every strike. Their bodies were black, their eyes white, their hearts shimmered with stardust. Sliding at the rooftops, creating black ooze to attach and swing from the walls. Ally would often grab Houston's face and blind them with fireworks from her fingertips, Houston on the other hand would always try to stab her face and chest. Crashing through walls and glass, sustaining injury one after another, Houston would retreat into the Cathedral and Ally would chase them without any hesitation.

"Hey, wanna see my new gadget?" Little Houston would tilt their head, holding something behind their back with both of their hands.

"Oh, sure!" Young Ally would slide into their room, decorated and rich.

"Look at this insane gun!" They'd handle it in front of them, "It used to be just this boring toy gun, but I ain't so lame. I tweaked it and now it can shoot snowballs!"

"No. Way." She was in awe, "Let's go outside, test it on me!"

"But..." They were hesitant, "I already tested it?"

"I'll tell ya how it feels to get hit, come on!" She opened a window, from which she crawled back into the suburban landscape.

Ally created chakrams from her wicked hands. Throwing, missing, retrieving. Houston slid up to their bag which they left behind, opened. With a swift move they took out their sniper and fired at Ally with bullets created from light. It tore through Ally, but it was no use, they missed the core. They fired again and again, eager to hit her heart before she'd get too close. Each shot that erased a piece of her grew back into an unfamiliar silhouette, almost bear-like features. She'd tackle Houston again, pinning them against the stained carpet on the floor. With hesitant claws, she'd proceed to dig into their mouth to tear their head wide open. Melting into one another, black ooze sprawling everywhere. Sentries would come appearing through the walls, setting a laser sight on Ally, "Target set." A cold robotic voice echoed. Four gunshots to the head, a heavy caliber rifle, Ally was knocked on the floor with a bleeding head. Houston's injury took a while to recover, but once it has, they stood up breathing heavily. Their features were mouse-like, but yet, still an unstable black silhouette. The sight of Ally's corpse frightened them, having difficulty to get their gadget out again to create another gate back to their home. Before they knew, Ally's hand raised and a chakram appeared at the palm. With a throw it managed to pierce directly through one sentry, bouncing from a wall right back into the other, then back into her hand.

"That's pretty fun." Young Ally spoke with wonder and a soft smile, "It doesn't even hurt!"

"Yeah, until the snow gets on the back under your clothes." They giggled.

"Houston." She grew more tired, sad, "Will you ever come back home?"

"I don't know." They said, looking down, "I only came here for a bit, y'know? It's my parents work, something for the government, I'm sorry."

They were met with a tight hug from Ally, "Please, don't leave." She dug her face into them, "I don't care what you are, what you have done, we can get that sorted out! I just want to be best friends forever, just kids, playing around in our hometown without worry."

With a grab, Ally took ahold of Houston's neck and held them up in the air. Without second thought, she smashed him against the walls, the floors, they were absolutely defenseless. In a constant torture of regeneration, Houston's silhouette spazzed out more and more with each hit. With a final blow, Ally tossed them on the ground, getting onto them to claw more and more of their body out. One strike after another, punches of pure desperation and agony, their core in the chest was exposed. It shimmered, glowing with love. Ally continued her relentless strikes, cracking the orb with each cut, until the final hit. Once the core was seemingly about to explode, her movement grew slower, weakened. She couldn't bring herself to kill them, an emotional wave struck her and she laid down on their body to sob. Her tears descended into their core, which had found their way to glue the cracks and heal the wound. Eventually, Ally would collapse, and Houston would wake. They'd get off her body and take in the silence, the guilt. Both of them were torn to bits, shredded, unstable, taking in the form of their lovers who had passed their hearts to them. With trembling hands, Houston rummaged through their hands to get a copy of the gadget. With a simple press of a button, a shining white gate opened and they'd step right through it without looking back. They were disturbed, silent, but most importantly heartbroken.

"Oh there you are! What a way to leave the trail of the prophecy!" Rose would cheer on Houston, back at the Babylon's main private lobby.

But their bleeding unstable body would just continue to march, without a word. Ferdinand reached out for a simple delicious sandwich on a tray, but Houston with a striking claw snatched multiple out of the tray leaving none left. The normal atmosphere turned rotten, an awkward silence as the black ooze spread on the floor.
