"Oh my lord." Would be the best way to put it, as said by the one and only Ferd. Flabbergasted, joyous, that line spoken by Ena would change everything they know about their current lives forever.

During the intermission days between active missions, everyone worked together to sustain enough food and water whilst also working on their needs at the outpost. The Disobedient barely sent anything over, so all the allies had to deal with what they got. Ferd and Ena talked and plotted, thinking too much on how to come out with these great news. It wouldn't be easy, they couldn't just come out and reveal such secret, they had to come up with a way to maturely and privately sort things out at the camp. Once another night came, both of them sat at their cliffside and chatted more. Interestingly enough, Ena brought a bag with herself this time.

"...anything new?" Ferd asked, smiling.

"I was thinking, holding another surprise for you..." She dropped her bag and rustled through it, "That one kinda cringey song we keep playing each year around our anniversary since enlistment..."

"Oh? Is it that time again? I thought you have stopped since last year, you were really not happy with your skills back there." He tilted his head.

Ena brought out an average black guitar out of the bag, shiny and clean, "I decided, why not?"

"Sweetie..." He'd speak, "That's rad, are you getting back onto playing?"

"Hell yeah." She'd confidently smirk, "Let me just play my favorite little tune..."

Her fingers trailed over the strings and danced, she played a small somber tune, terribly.

"Oh, that stingy feeling is coming back." She'd groan.

She played more on the guitar, attempting to get the tune right, failing miserably. Failure after failure, she'd grow more frustrated and her playing became more rancid.

"This, STUPID, guit-"

She felt the touch of Ferd encompass her, and in that small moment it seemed like as if all the stress had suddenly washed away. 

"Bold move." She'd close her eyes and smile, "Deep breaths, I know."

Ferd quietly talked, "You'll get it right this time, just watch."

So she listened and played, all went flawlessly until she truck one note wrong and the whole melody went downhill. She gave a mean look towards Ferd, "It never works when you say that." She smirked. She took a deep breath and decided to play again. Slowly and smoothly, focused on the melody, she finally managed to play it out flawlessly. Ferd smiled and clapped like a seal.

Without saying anything, she began to play a familiar song and sing alongside it.

"*Around fifteen years back do you remember how it all began?*"

"*...we were assigned an ol' boring project that bloomed into such beauty?*" Ferd joined in.

"*Wouldn't call it a beauty, honey, it was more of a chaotic journey!*"

"*Dusted off an old computer next thing we know we're in a simulation of doom and despair.*"

"*We were given color, weapons, like a dream come true to fend off against the hordes of enemies!*"

"*We slashed and fired, becoming stronger together to beat the final boss of this game...*"

"*JEREMIA, it's what they call it, turns out it was actually really epic and lame!*"

Ena began to strum differently, turning the joyful melody into something more somber and tense.

"*Once the whole program broke, you came right by my world, met all my brothers and sisters...*"

"Um, I don't remember that part-" And he was shhhhhhhhhh'd by Ena's finger on his mouth.

"*Marked with red stark fur, a cursor out of your chest, what a terrible sight!*"

"I-"

"*You met me, a younger me, who was never happy with anything!*"

Ferd decided to just listen at this point, listening with curiosity as the melody grew more hopeful and mighty.

"*And you took the real me out of the monster, and together we beat my ass!*"

Ena was going off the rails completely, intensely strumming the guitar like as if it was an electric one. Ferd placed his hand on her shoulder and asked, "Huh??" She paused.

She laughed, and continued playing, "*You know, I came up with all this on the spooooooooot for fuuuuuuuuun 'cause this song was missing something awesome!*"

He just smiled and nodded, continuing the song, "*And then right after school we became the best friends of all.*"

"*AND THEN WE CAME BACK TO THE PROGRAM FOR SOME CRAZY ASS JOURNEY, WE CLIMBED A TOWER AND KILLED A GOD-*"

Ferd just gave her a weird look, she paused and coughed. "*That sweet tender relation between us only served as a gate for true love.*.."

"*We are gonna skip over our post-graduation lives because that sucked tremendously.*"

"*...So we decided to enlist in a military service, unknowingly sent to whatever hell somewhere deep in space.*"

"*But it was no worry, that's what the program trained us for!*"

Well, the rest of the song was about their missions. Jumping off planes, demolishing towers, meeting new faces, exploring the unknown. Once they reached the end of their song with a newly added verse that went around their latest mission, they laid down on the grass, catching their breath.

"We're never growing up from this awfully constructed song, are we?" She giggled.

"No, never." He replied, "Maybe you could turn it into some sort of real song, since our retirement is so close already."

"Yeah..." She looked down at herself, "Tomorrow, I'll try to get things sorted out with the leader. I'm kinda worried if I'm being honest."

"Can't imagine it's gonna be too bad." He nuzzled closer, "I do wonder how the reactions gonna be, though."

After their small exchange, as the night turned darker, they finally went back to their scrappy home to sleep.
The next day went by as usual, everyone was busy fixing stuff or playing chess and harmonicas. Vlad was busy fixing up Isaac, feeding him gunpowder, re-growing his small abnormal humanoid body. Sometime around noon, Ena waved to Ferd as she set off to finally talk to the leader about their secret, as for him he would huddle around the television to watch some news.

"...Dawn of the Green Light's expenses keep rising, Disobedient leaders claim it hass gotten to a point where its completely unsustainable..."

"...Today is 'national chili dog day', experts claim..."

"...multiple WB-110's, also known as 'Big Ants', are set to deploy onto scrap planets..."

Upon hearing those news, many jumped in joy, those machines were powerful and beautiful, capable of many things.

"...upon shocking development, the 'New Babylon' has formed a partnership with the 'Citadel'. A famous elite 'Citadelarian' codenamed "ROSE" has joined the development of something secret within the 'New Babylon'..."

That joy, was cut short after these news. Even Vlad himself was surprised, he walked into the room and came closer to the screen.

"...this is the beginning of a new peaceful age, claims a minister of 'New Babylon'. No one knows what is being developed, commanders say to prepare..."

"...remember to stay vigilant..."

A single tear of sweat dropped from one of the allies' head. Everyone was frozen, shocked, a possible alliance between the two strongest known nations would lead to a terrible future. Paired with the financial crisis of the Disobedient, things were shaping up to be in a really rough spot. Multiple devices rang out at once, a new order was placed on multiple allies. "Gather scrap, intel, anything to reinforce the outpost..."

Ena finally spilled out everything she had going on with Ferd to her commander. That commander, she was a bulky woman named Lips. Unforgiving, brave, and strong, her arms were crossed as she listened.

"Ena." Lips' reply shook her. She grabbed her shoulders, "Why would you do this?" She said with a sharp stare.

"Um." She gulped, "For early retirement, I suppose." She looked down, her eyes looking elsewhere.

"By this point, you should know there is NO such thing as retirement!" She groaned, "I like you, Ena. You somehow survived dozens of missions, only one time coming back severely injured. You would deserve retirement if it was possible, but I CAN'T allow that!" She'd crack her knuckles. "Anyone sent here is stuck forever! We're running out of resources, weaponry, it's doomed! We're completely forgotten about!"

"I know." Ena would reply, "I'm well aware."

Lips turned her face to her, "Girl, you better not go absent. The higher ranks really hate that."

"Well, I don't know how to put it, it's complicated." She'd continue, "I-"

Suddenly, an important mission was announced, completely interrupting the private conversation between them. Lips checked her personal device and upon reading, she rushed off somewhere to manage things immediately. Ena stood there, playing with her fingers, staring blindly just thinking.

"Well..." She talked to herself, "Um..."
