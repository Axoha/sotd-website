In the fields of white, two lovers lay. The King and the Queen, exhausted, but free. The castle looms from afar, the sky is blue. They both get up, slowly, but after seeing each other they run through the fields to greet. They clash in a tight hug, embracing one another, letting their love finally take place without the worlds ending.

"It's been far too long." Ena pours into his shoulder, "I can breathe, I am free, you're finally with me."

"...is all of this truly happening?" Ferd replies.

"Yes!" She looks him in the eyes, "I'm here!"

"I can't believe it." He fell into her arms, "I can't believe it..."

--

She looks to a direction where the grand castle stood in its place, "Oh, there's so much I need to tell you." She said, as her hands roamed through his fur. 

Ena gently holds his hand, "Let's go, let me show you around this place."

So, honey, this is the palace. I suppose you remember who I actually am, right?

The royal daughter of the King and the Queen, the princess. I remember.

You know... I didn't know of it myself, until that one simulation thing. When we explored that mess of a junk that was the old Citadelarian computer again. I kinda brought it up in our song months ago. I don't know how to explain it, but you weren't there, your heart was.

I've been wondering about that...

Same as you, but with red marks rather than black. It's such an oddity, but back to what I was actually saying. At the end of those strange travels, my whole future, and the past, was laid out in front of me. Your heart came running to me, really upset about something I don't really remember anymore. Soon after we came back to the real world, we woke up, and you didn't remember a thing! I never wanted to tell you what actually happened afterwards, sorry.

...

I thought I could try and defy FATE, y'know? That it would never happen... well, it always finds a way doesn't it?

...Tell me about this place, actually. I'd love to hear more about... this you.

Well, I'm the sudden Queen. I don't remember my parents, only that they existed. I'm just as inexperienced in this! I was given a crown without warning, quickly explained what I was, ugh, that was so frustrating! I was taken away from the ongoing tale to serve as a mere goal for you to reach. Often times, my whole body would become this monstrous thing just to enforce that narrative furthermore! I had no control... but when I did, we became that great fused thing.

*They walk towards a cherry tree, the only color in the fields. The cheek on Ferd cracks, Ena notices but doesn't say a thing.*

I like this tree.

Yeah, it's pretty.

Let's hangout here!

Really? What about the castle, though?

Some other day.

Wait, where even are we? Am I dead?

Oh, no no no. Masy must've like, created a small bubble where we can exist together. Just as told in the first prophecy, the one bubble the King and the Queen had.

...Is it temporary?

Here!

*Ena picks the deep red cherries from the branches.*

Taste 'em! Once in a lifetime opportunity.

*Ferd looks at the cherries hesitantly, but decides to eat one whole piece.*

Delicious.

I know right?

*Ena extends her leftmost hand, conjures a guitar.*

I've been dying to play this song with you again.

*Ferd looks at her, dazed.*

Don't worry, this time I won't fumble as much as I have...

*Around fifteen years back do you remember how it all began?*

*Ferd was ecstatic.*

*...we were assigned an ol' boring project that bloomed into such beauty?*

*Wouldn't call it a beauty, honey, it was more of a chaotic journey!*

*Dusted off an old computer next thing we know we're in a simulation of doom and despair.*

*We were given color, weapons, like a dream come true to fend off against the hordes of enemies!*

*We slashed and fired, becoming stronger together to beat the final boss of this game...*

*JEREMIA, it's what they call it, turns out it was actually really epic and lame!*

*Once the whole program broke, you came right by my world, met all my brothers and sisters...*

*Marked with red stark fur, a cursor out of your chest, what a terrible sight!*

*You met me, a younger me, who was never happy with anything!*

*And you took the real me out of the monster, and together we beat my ass!*

*And then right after school we became the best friends of all.*

*AND THEN WE CAME BACK TO THE PROGRAM FOR SOME CRAZY ASS JOURNEY, WE CLIMBED A TOWER AND KILLED A GOD. STOLE HIS HEART AND SAW THE WHOLE PROPHECY. OH WHATA FRUSTRATING FRANTIC JOURNEY!!!*

*That sweet tender relation between us only served as a gate for true love.*..

*We are gonna skip over our post-graduation lives because that sucked tremendously!!!*

*...So we decided to enlist in a military service, unknowingly sent to whatever hell somewhere deep in space.*

*But it was no worry, that's what the program trained us for!*

*The rest of the song was about their new and old lives. Jumping off planes, demolishing towers, meeting new faces, exploring the unknown. Once they reached the end of their song with tons of verses encapsulating both of their adventures, they laid down on the grass, catching their breath.*

We're never growing up from this awfully constructed song, are we?

--

They spent hours frolicking in the fields, playing, embracing the moment. They chased, they watched, they kissed. They were no King and Queen, they were only innocent young adults. The sun began to set, the skies turned purple. They came back to the cherry tree to catch their breath, talking about whatever nonsense struck their minds.

"Ferd..."

"Hm?" His ears perk towards her.

"You have really nice friends out there." She looks down.

"Ally? Houston?" He tilts his head.

"Them, yes!" She looks at him, "Do you miss them?"

Ferd took a moment to think, looking back at all his past memory, "I do." he answered honestly.

The crack on Ferd's face only grew larger, unbeknownst to him.  

"That's... lovely." She replies.

They both look at the descending sun, the sky growing only darker. He needs to come back to his life, I know, he has to. I can't let him stay here. The child. My child.

"Ferd..." I speak.

"What's up?" He replies.

I waste no second, I tackle him with a hug which evolves right into a deep kiss. I roam my hands through his back, he does too. I'll miss him, I truly will. I step back, his face close to mine.

"Tell your friends, I said hi."

"Huh???" Oh, my poor heart, fear strikes him.

"Farewell..." I say, before I turn my left hand into a gauntlet and strike the crack on his face with a full blow. He can't stay here, he can't! He can't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ACT III - POSITIVE - Our child.**

In the void, a white plant grows. Ferd, struggling to get up, looks towards the light. The plant grows at an exponential rate, until, the final moment, it begins to take form. A silhouette, formed from black ooze. The eyes, from her mother. The rustled hair, from her mother. The courage, from her father. She opens her white, glowing eyes.

The sacred child, is born. The name both Ferd and Ena always wished upon their child, Sammy.
