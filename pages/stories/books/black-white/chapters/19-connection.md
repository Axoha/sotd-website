*I woke up in my bed...*
*At the middle of the night.*
*...*
*I went back to sleep immediately.*
*Wait, no no no, there's food right next to me.*
*Still warm, a toasted sandwich and hot cocoa, interesting?*
*It was hard to see in the darkness, I reached my hand out to the faintly lit meal...*
*Ough, fuck, it's delicious.*
*Holy, who made this!?*
*Oh, right, Masy... That's a nice little note.*

The following morning Ferd simply awoke again and stepped out of his scrappy container-home. It was a nice sunny day outside, he didn't have much of a reaction to the weather.

"Ferd?!" Ally immediately rushed next to him, "Are you okay?! Please respond!"

"Um, yeah?" He was confused. He quickly noticed that she was using crutches, "What happened?"

"You were acting so weird!!!" She sounded deathly worried, "We saw you, but you were mute, your gauntlet was all weird, and you had a creepy soulless stare! You didn't react to anything! We were all boarded on a rescue ship of some sort and you were just sitting there all silent?! Jeez..."

"Oh..." He remembered a moment, a day ago when he'd let Masy take control. He was partially glad that she wasn't really doing anything rancid.

"And then you cooked yourself food at night. You haven't eaten anything that whole day, I was glad. I came up to you and you offered me a bite? That sandwich was so good, dude, since when were you so good at this sort of stuff?" She sounded more relieved.

"I mean I'm fine, I don't remember what happened after that whole train scene." He tried to reassure her somewhat, "But I'm sure nothing terrible occurred, I'm fine."

She wiped a tear of sweat from her forehead, silent. "...Can I have another bite?" She asked after a while.

Ferd was met with another dilemma, the sandwich has been already eaten and Masy was nowhere to be seen...
They'd later reunite with Houston, asking the same questions, before everyone would eventually be called into headquarters of the camp for another briefing. Lips wasted no time, aggressively urging everyone to take a seat as fast as possible. The room was filled with chatter, rumors, all the spice.

"Pops, I'll start with the good news..." She coughed into a fist, shuffling through papers, "No one from our camp died, congratulations."

It was silent. No one had a clue on how to react, until a fellow started wildly celebrating. Others slowly joined in as well, they all managed to see another day.

"SHUT UP!!!" She yelled, everyone silent in an instant. She coughed again, "The bad news. The strange dimension that we were in took a whole week out of our mission! Tons of missed calls! Tons of opportunities wasted! For the next mission we'll have to act as fast as we can, using EVERYTHING that we gathered from our last mission."

Everyone silently watched, the fellow who celebrated awkwardly put their shirt back on.

"I'm going to ask a serious question, and I hope one of you answer honestly." She adjusted her microphone...

"...Who fired the sniper round?"

It was dead silent, no one raised a hand.

"It could not have been the Babylon, at least to our knowledge every soldier from that side was in our captivity!" She raised her voice.

It was still silent.

She sighed, "Well, to whoever managed to shoot the queen, you sparked hope. She bleeds, she's weak, with enough planning and precision we can complete our mission. She is not immortal as assumed, simply just light is a weakness we can exploit..."

Ferd watched nervously, this whole time he thought the queen just sensed something wrong and escaped with him from the underworld.

"...The samples we collected also further prove our theory, a strong light corrodes any sustenance from the monochrome regions. Our next equipment will arrive shortly, experimental tools utilizing likely lasers, flashlights, anything like that..." Lips went on to blabber about necessary intel.

Chatter slowly grew among the audience.

"I AM NOT DONE YET!!!" It was like as if her voice became hoarser with each yell, she coughed into a fist again, shuffling through the papers once more, "Last thing before I let everyone go."

The crowd looked with curious eyes, in complete silence.

"The strange occurrence that stopped us from stopping the train full of cargo..." Her voice turned dead-serious, "More images surfaced from the higher-ups, a massive black arm emerged from the biggest car of the train. A white beam followed from the palm of the hand, completely eviscerating a dropship which carried an Ant planned to be deployed on the train. The arm quickly retracted back into the car, as to why we saw nothing while retreating."

Multiple images appeared on the board, presenting in a slideshow format. Multiple angles, sounds, and last recordings retrieved from black boxes. The crowd watched with chills, worry.

"That's all, see you once the equipment arrives." She dropped the papers and walked out.

Everyone walked out of the headquarters with a lot of words to share, but Ferd was mainly focused on Ally using crutches. Him, her, and Houston walked out blabbering on about random things.

"So about that sandwich I owe ya." They smugly spoke, "I'm making one for Ally too, she deserves it."

She gasped, "No - way."

"Damn right." They smiled, "I'm making a sandwich for me too, whole sandwich party at that, with that delicious toasted bread and lettuce, eggs, bacon..."

Ally and Houston started drooling as they continued to list the ingredients.

"You two have gotten a lot closer while I was gone, huh?" Ferd interrupted their daydream.

"I totes consider them a bestie now!" She said with glee, "They aren't so lame and boring like how I thought, they genuinely impressed me?! So caring, daring to touch such a dirty wastelander!"

Houston looked at their hands, surprised, they apparently haven't wore gloves in a long while. "Right, I don't think I care about that anymore."

"What's up with those crutches, by the way?" He finally asked a question he's been holding onto for so long.

"Oh, those..." She looked down, "Here's the weird part, apparently my body can actually regenerate wounds and injuries really fast? But I was shot by this bullet which was like, special, lodged in my calf, preventing my body from doing its thing! The doctor around managed to take it out, it was glowing white, eerie!"

Ferd thought back to the day before, when the queen crashed onto the train with a bleeding wound on her forehead. The blood was glowing and white.

"...And then he told me to use crutches in the meantime, telling my body should heal in like a day. Man, it hurts to walk!" She talked, "Are you here?"

"Oh, yeah, just thinking..." He scratched his head.

"Ferd!" A deep voice sound from behind, he'd be soon obscured by a shadow.

He slowly turned around, "...Vlad?"

"Boy, we have not talked in a long while. What was up with you yesterday?!" His tone was surprisingly light.

"Well, it's hard to-"

"You do not need to even tell me, I want you to prove it." He cheered, "Ever since I saw you with that gauntlet, how you clumsily fumbled through everything, I always thought of teaching you! But *YESTERDAY*, I saw you standing your ground, fighting off against *HORDES*, without breaking a sweat?! And before that, you managed to tame a beast! You have always been full of surprises, but lately you have been taking it to new limits!"

Ferd awkwardly scratched the back of his head, "Uh, thanks?"

"What a puny response!" He laughed, "Never in my thirty years of service have I ever seen a guy so entertaining. Everyone has their eyes on you, boy! I challenge you to a fight, a legendary gauntlet wielder against me."

Ally nudged at Ferd to accept the challenge, multiple fellows around overheard him and stood around with intrigue.

"Let's brawl." He accepted the challenge, he couldn't help but smile.

A circle was cleared out for both of them. Small crowds of fellows and his closest friends, Ferd looked around feeling like a celebrity after all those words. On the ground of dirt and barely grown grass, Vlad stood his ground, eight feet tall revving his giant mechanical arm.

"You have one task..." He swung his arm to his left side, "Push me out of the circle, boy. Infinite attempts, limited time."

He gulped, he was aware of what he saw in him yesterday was all Masy. Isaac was sat in the distance, blasting an airhorn to begin the fight.
Vlad blitzed right onto Ferd. With no time to evade or think, he hit him with an unforgiving gut punch. The small audience winced, that hurt.

"Beginning like this..." Ferd held his stomach as Vlad stood above him.

"One thing I noticed." He walked back to the center of the circle, "You are indestructible!"

Ferd let go of his bruise and it was suddenly missing, though it still hurt.

"Do not hold back, boy!" He spread out his arms, "Show the camp what you got! Learn something new!"

It was his time to shine, with clumsy steps he dashed over to him and threw the hardest punch he could with the gauntlet. Vlad blocked it with his own mechanical arm, the force surprisingly strong, managing to push him back. Ferd understood his physical capability was outmatched by him, he'd need to find a different way to get him out of the arena. Vlad swung with his mechanical arm to push him off momentarily, right before Ferd would slide back throwing another hard punch. He looked to the ground, unorganized equipment was scattered all across the floor. He backed off as Vlad turned more offensive, throwing even more devastating punches. He manipulated the tide to get closer to scrapped wire, which he sneakily managed to pick up as he protected himself with the gauntlet. More people began to surround the circle, curious as to what was going on. Some cheered for either Ferd or Vlad, it was a fun time. Ferd found the perfect opportunity, grabbing the wire with both of his hands and getting it around Vlad's neck, tugging it to drop him on the floor with surprising force. He smiled, Ferd was getting creative. Vlad grabbed his leg as he was struggling to get him out of the circle, tossing him onto the other side of the arena. He slid up to Ally and Houston's feet, and without hesitation he grabbed one of Ally's crutches to use. The audience gasped at such a controversial, yet funny move as Ally cursed him. Ferd also grabbed a handful of dirt, and seconds later he'd hurl it at Vlad's eyes to temporarily blind him as he marched closer to Ferd. He'd use the short moment to lodge Ally's crutch into his mechanical arm rendering it useless, and with the previous wire that was tossed aside he'd pick it up from the ground and tug it around his neck again... all that to get punched in the face with Vlads' other arm, knocked onto the floor.

"Marvelous." He smiled, "And you did not even use the gauntlet as how I have seen."

Ferd crawled up, his nose bleeding furiously, "...I win."

"What?" Vlad was confused until he looked down, he was standing just out of the circle. He closed his eyes and continued to smile.

Everyone from the camp was huddled around to witness the short brawl. Cheering, betting, Lips watched from a distance smiling with her arms crossed - she knew Vlad was holding back. Ferd walked up to Ally and Houston, feeling guilty for just taking the crutch like that.

"Ferd." She looked at him with serious, saddened eyes, "That was awesome?! What a show!" Her face suddenly turned into ecstasy.

"I hope you never did that before..." Houston nervously scratched their neck with mixed feelings, "But that was pretty cool, I ain't lyin'."

That brawl became the talk of the day. The equipment arrived, another briefing was held, and the trio decided to end the day on the sandwiched promise at the cafeteria.

"Damn, you never let down with sandwiches!" Ally spoke with her mouth full, drowning in ecstasy.

"Heh, thanks." They smirked, "Can't believe this whole mission comes with benefits, such as getting better ingredients."

"Have you guys ever seen the movie 'The Thing'?" Ferd spoke before taking another bite, "Well, the thing I'm about to say has nothing to do with the movie itself I'm talking about the poster."

"Yeah."
"Nope."

"The new suits remind me of that poster." He chewed, "I wonder if they somehow fit some light bulbs on the head?!"

"Y'all I hope we don't encounter some shape-shifting alien. That movie gave me nightmares back then!" They smiled, eating their sandwich overloaded with lettuce.

"I mean..." He was almost done eating his sandwich, "Actually, never-mind."

"The next mission intrigues me." Ally spoke her mind, "*Love City*, just what kind of name is that?"

"I think that's like a codename. Ain't no way that's the actual name." Houston shook their head, swinging on the chair.

"Isaac mentioned having connections there? We'll be the ones sent to investigate, I'm curious how that's gonna go." Ferd finally finished his sandwich.

"I imagine it'll be boring as hell for the rest of the camp." They looked up at the ceiling, "Watching from afar on a ship, just how lucky are we to have you as the main character around!"

The sun began to set as they ended their talks, the makeshift lampposts of the camp began to turn on as day shifted into night. The trio walked out of the cafeteria last, told each other goodbyes as they returned to their new homes.

"Wait." Ally turned back to Ferd, "I have one more thing in mind."

"What is it?" He asked, tilting his head.

"I just wanna say..." She looked down, "I'm happy to see you happy, y'know? Just like a week ago you were so wrecked over grief, I'm glad you're taking the right steps forward. That's all." She smiled.

And she left without giving Ferd a say.
He'd stumble back to his bed, thinking about today, thinking about yesterday, thinking about the last week. The next mission would have to be the last, perfected, but he wasn't letting the pressure get to him. Somehow, he knew things would turn out fine, even without Ena telling him so.

*Ferd, are you awake?*
*I suppose not.*
*I didn't really want to talk about this, but...*
*I explored a bit of the train while I was in control, sorry about that.*
*...*
*I saw some things.*
*Some things I wish to forget, and never see again.*
