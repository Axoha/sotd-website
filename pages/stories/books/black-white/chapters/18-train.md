The Queen backed away, intensively bleeding from her forehead. Their ears rang, the world spun around them. With a numbingly loud roar, the Queen snatched Ferd and extended its wings, launching up in the air straight through the roof of the ruined cathedral.

"Houston!!!" Ally yelled out at the crumbling rooftops.

"I'm alive!" They yelled back, running and clumsily slipping onto the floor, "Jeez, do you have any idea what happened?!"

"No! I just heard a gunshot and everything just went loose! Terribly! Where's Ferd?!" She helped them get back on their feet, panicked.

Houston looked up to see white sparkles fly from the Queen, "We can't lose track. We gotta go, now."

Ally looked where they were looking, "How are we possibly gonna catch up to her?!"

They rummaged through their bag, getting ahold of a gadget that looked like a crate with handle bars. They extended the handles with force, initiating a full mechanism which turned the crate into a mobile all-terrain bike. "Hop on." They said, hopping on the bike and immediately blitzing off with what limited fuel it had.

"I guess that clears our first step." Lips looked at the Queen, far in the distance, "Call in the Disobedient forces, we have a potential advancement to be made."

"You have to let us go, now!" Bill pleaded, "It is headed straight for the station built to study the abyss, at least get us to a gate and we'll jump there right away!"

"A gate?" She looked confused, "Sure, get us there."

Conveniently a gate wasn't that far off, Bill requested Rose to be the one to shift the coordinates. All of them were still held at gunpoint, Rose took out a gadget which he used to stab the gate, and then input a code in strange symbols to open a portal directly into the station.

"Happy hunting." He grumbled.

"Not so fast." Lips was suspicious, "Vlad, you are durable, go check for us."

Surprisingly, he gladly took the role. He casually walked through the gate and looked around, it was an average station on the surface of a completely different planet during daytime. Right as he was about to speak, the walls have been smashed by the Queen's flight. That alone was all the convincing they needed, everyone hurried through the portal.

Out of the underworld, the Queen flew with the majestic wings of a dragon. Ferd couldn't do anything, her grip was far too strong, he was stuck to her body with little to no hope. The outside was lush and green without clouds to cover the strong sunlight. The sun seemed to damage her, her flight was completely disoriented, her wings began to burn. She followed the train tracks that spanned out through the whole region, eventually finding a moving cargo train to slam right into. Her grip on Ferd loosened, she immediately tore a hole in the train and hid inside for darkness. The scale of the train itself mesmerized him, this wasn't anything ordinary, but he quickly snapped back as he realized she was gone again. He ran into the inside of the train, and to a surprise, it was infested with armed Citadelarians.
Houston and Ally rose from the underworld's many gaping holes, following the flat train tracks on the bike at ludicrous speeds. Their fuel was already running out, Houston noticed the rising smoke from the train ahead and figured, he asked Ally to grab a tow hook and fire at the train's end. She flawlessly established a fine connection with the steel wire, allowing them to climb onto the train, leaving the bike behind.

"Vitamin Citadel corp..." Ally read the title on the train's side out loud, "We grow because we care?!" She was utterly confused.

"Oh my god, it's those!" Houston groaned, "Citadelarians, citadelarians, you have a gun?"

"No... I lost it." She shook her head, "But maybe-"

Houston opened a vent on the train's side, they fit themselves inside. A few punches and gunshots later, they came back to the rooftop with a blood-stained Citadelarian rifle.

"Aim for their eyes. Their robes are composed of a material which light weapons such as these cannot damage." They smirked.

She was impressed, surprised without a word, gladly taking the gun. She never fought as a soldier on the frontlines, this was her first time carrying a Citadelarian rifle.

"Let's go, we need to get back to him!"

Ferd calmly walked out of the train car, seconds later the whole laser barrage began. Piercing through the walls, a shadow wall was fabricated by Masy from the gauntlet out of thin air to protect him from all the shots he'd take from the initial fire.

"Go in!" She urged him, "Cover yourself with me!"

He listened, nodding. He began by exposing just his gauntlet through the door, letting Masy use her unknown abilities to set the Citadelarians unconscious. After all seemed clear, he walked back inside to the sight of all the Citadelarians snoozing, and those that weren't were quickly neutralized with a sharp black dagger which set them to sleep. Ferd reached out for a rifle, but his other hand was quickly slapped by the gauntlet.

"No murder!" She seemed pissed.

Houston and Ally continued to crawl through the rooftops of the train cars, the wind fierce and unforgiving. Passing by some of the cars made them really dizzy, but they managed to persevere by sticking together. Getting closer to the smoke, their progress was halted by a sudden crash from behind. Another train car suddenly joined the current pack. 

"Perfect, we are connected." Rose was satisfied, "Now, happy hunting?! Let us go!?"

"Nah." Lips smirked, "Tie this whole Babylon group, will ya?" She signaled the rest of the Disobedient crew around with her fingers.

Carrying ropes in their hands, the party was interrupted by sudden forces. Teleporting and tall skinny Citadelarians appeared right out of nowhere, disarming the whole crew in seconds. Rose got ahold of a gun.

"How unfortunate." He sighed, "Least my retainers finally came around, took long enough."

"You bastard." Lips spat, held tight by the retainers.

"What? You were the ones holding us hostage the entire time!" He complained, "Say your prayers or whatever the Disobedient's culture is, I'm done!"

Bill grabbed his head, "Don't kill, we don't care for them! Quit wastin' time and let's go after what's important."

"Whatever you say boss." He sighed, "Such a satisfying outcome ruined!"

Them and the remaining Babylon black ops left the train car securely locking the door behind. The retainers also vanished, leaving the Disobedient crew alive and trapped.

"I nominate we use Vlad as a battering ram!!!" Isaac maniacally laughed amidst the silence.

Ferd continued his trip within the colossal train, going floor after floor following the blank ink smothered on the floor. The lights suddenly flickered, and in a flash he was surrounded by retainers. They've tried to grab him, but a single touch of Ferd slowly disintegrated their hand. Their plan has changed to incapacitate Ferd, aiming and firing instantaneously. Masy overworked herself, creating portals and walls to not let even a single shot graze him. Ferd tried to evade their strikes somewhat, but going up against hyper-intelligent unknown life did not help. The retainers could predict, any cover he could take was covered by other retainers. Any option of his escape was reduced to zero. Ferd internally panicked as the retainers appeared and vanished, he never encountered such beings. One was down with a dagger to its chest, out of the dozen still alive calculating the perfect vision to capture Ferd. Suddenly, the Queen's roar sound floors away. The retainers all shifted their focus to the direction of the sound like a single mind, vanishing without a trace. Ferd dizzily walked around, eventually leaning and resting onto a wall. Both him and Masy took shallow breaths, that encounter was too much, and yet more was still coming.
Houston and Ally continued their crawl atop the train cars. Loud muffled banging shook the whole car, until without a warning, a giant black arm penetrated the roof. Both of them froze, the hand swiftly descended back into the car until it suddenly hit from another point. They both slowly moved, not making a single sound, sensing the rumbling from beneath. Houston's bag was zipped terribly, a small screwdriver found its way out and caused an awkward sequence of knocks. The hand rose right below them and snatched their leg, dragging them right below the floor beneath. They were slammed onto the cold steel floor, the Queen was all around them in an unrecognizable shape within the fully dark room. Ally rushed to one of the holes punctured by her, but her feeble attempt at helping them out was stopped by retainers; she was surrounded. Houston fumbled their bag as they rushed back, taking out a special stimulant to inject themselves with. The Queen roared directly into their face as they continued to rummage through the bag in hurry. They grabbed their trustworthy shotgun with a single hand, tossing the bag aside to jump up and grab onto the wire on the ceiling, evading a blowing strike. They fired at her head, pushing her back. They spun the shotgun with a single hand to reload and fire again, and again, and again. They felt guilty with each shot fired, but they proceeded until there were no shells remaining. They'd find a door to sneakily run into, and they'd run through the long hallway as the extremely agitated Queen smashed through the wall behind and crawled through the walls. The lights turned off in a sequence as she chased them, the darkness only empowering her.
Ally struggled to hold off against the retainers, by sheer luck she managed to hit a retainer with the rifle she was given, but it barely helped the situation. She slithered through their grasps, rolling and evading whatever they had. She was hit multiple times, but she stood her ground, some retainers have already backed away to find the Queen. The retainers shot at her legs, scoring a few hits as she fell on the roof in pain, they came closer until jet engines sound beneath the bridge of the train tracks. A Disobedient ship appeared along with many others, and a dropship carrying a Big Ant. One of the ship revved up its machine guns and brutally mowed the retainers off of Ally. She sighed in relief, resting her head on on the roof taking deep breaths.

"Okay, on one, we slam this dude as hard as we possibly can!" Isaac stood firmly like a commander on Vlad's body, who was currently being carried by six people. Vlad, not amused, reached out his mechanical hand to form a fist against the door. The whole rest of the crew stood around and began to count down.

Three...
Two...

The door was quickly disassembled with a blow torch by a special Disobedient team in thick armor and gas masks. It was silent, they all stared at each other.

"Doc, what do you plan on doing against all these Disobedient reinforcements around us now?!" Bill, unfamiliar with the Citadel as a whole, simply asked, "They'll completely wreck the whole train along with us!"

"Doesn't seem like the retainers are doing their job well, they needed more time in the improvement stage." Rose wasn't satisfied with the outcome, "Don't forget what we are carrying in the cargo, boss. A single use and it'll change the tide of battle in an instant."

"Right, your part of the deal..." Bill scratched their chin, "All those scientific breakthroughs and weapons, huh? Not my cup of tea."

"Everything seems fine, boss. I do not think we need to do anything here anymore. We're reaching our destination, soon the whole train's gonna accelerate into the Citadel." He confidently spoke, "We both know how it all goes, right? Everything's going back on track."

Meanwhile, Ferd ran through the long dark halls illuminated by a faint green light. He ran for so long that eventually he just started walking, the train lacked windows to look out of.

"Ferd, are you okay?" Masy asked.

"I don't know." He slowly walked, exhausted, "Do you have any idea what happened?"

"No." She closed her eyes, "Not at all, I don't have eyes everywhere!"

"I guess." He looked down.

It came to a point where he just sat down, resting against a wall. 

"There will be more times to get close to her. I don't know when, I don't know how, but I promise it should all turn out fine." She sighed, "The whole prophecy was meant to span out for nine months, but at the rate the territories are made, it will all likely be over in the next month."

There was nothing but the occasional muffled clanking of the tracks.

"Ferd." She spoke up again, "You can rest. I can take over your body, I can get you back to the camp safely."

Ferd didn't know how to react, but he gave in, the weight was too heavy. "Thank you." He said, as he closed his eyes and went to sleep.

The train approached and entered a tunnel, fully obscured by shadows. The Queen sensed the abyss, and retreated back outside to become one with the darkness. Houston was initially confused, but they caught up to their breath nonetheless, able to rest.

Vlad and Isaac proceeded through the train cars, taking down all the citadelarians around along with the advanced soldiers and the remainder of their crew. With miniguns, rifles, whatever weaponry at disposal, they were unstoppable. The dropship with the big ant was set to drop off the walker directly on the train to stop it in its tracks and destroy it. As the Disobedient went by, they reunited with Ally, then Houston, then something odd. The longer they stayed in the tunnel, the more intense the lights became. The faint rumbling grew stronger.

"*F-22* 'Smother' arrived. Ready to drop the ant, over."

"Smother, copy, ten seconds until arrival, over."

"Deploying- wait, what the hell is that?-"

...

"Smother is down, I repeat Smother is down! Retreat immediately, over!"
