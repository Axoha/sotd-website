The vessel strikes the floor, the ground shatters.
The vessel is unconscious, horribly weakened.
The vessel, is empty.

Deep below the conflict, in the depths of the abyss where nothing is seen lies the broken vessel, laying in the faded grass of forgotten plains. The gauntlet cracks, fades, and finally breaks down into holy fragments.

Silence, the wind howls.

...

An Inka comes by, disrupted by the sudden impact. Coming to examine the mistake, a hole in the universe that required patching. The problem turned out to be much larger, the object which defines the King was shattered into pieces. The Inka calls upon her brothers and sisters of all kind, small and large. In the coming minutes, they surround the vessel. The giants examined the fragments, but those could not be touched, they stung badly. The small ones examined the vessel's body, his heart beat in shining red.

That was the problem.

In an unfortunate only way to save the vessel, he has to be drained of all color to fulfill the prophecy. That is how it should've been from the start. If the vessel is drained of all holy matter, the gauntlet may be re-forged and put back on the vessel, and so he will be saved. A Guardian stepped up to his body, creating a spear in its hand to pierce the vessel's core. One heartbeat after another, the core slowly lost its distinct red color.

The color yelled out with plea, but the shadows did not listen. Once the core beat in white, the Guardian brought out their weapon and retreated back into the shadows. The gauntlet was repaired with deep care taken by the giants, and with slow and tender movements they equipped the King with his right weapon. The gauntlet shined in black with a thick white outline, his veins all around glowed and pulsed, his injury healed with each heartbeat. Once his eye began to move, the Inkas reached their hands out to help their King stand.


**ACT III CHAPTER XII - THE STORY OF BLACK AND WHITE**

Walking through the ashy tall grass, a path was carved from time. Dust particles filled the void, the ruins of a black palace loomed in the far distance. No Inka spoke a word, or even looked back at Ferd. They only guided his soul through the void. They approached the palace, closer and closer, the stroll was long and full of misery. They stopped at the grand entrance of the palace. A keyhole in a strange shape was fit in the gates. 

"Your majesty." A grown Inka, as tall as Ferd, appeared besides him, "It is time to create your own key, to your own palace."

He felt dull, numb. Oddly, he had nothing to ask. With slow movements, he opened up the palm of the gauntlet and thought of the key's shape. Light coursed for a moment, the key appeared in his hand. The Inkas left him be, the issue was patched.

He opened the gates to journey into the long hallway within. Dark, gray, forgotten. A guitar played somewhere far, a familiar somber tone he had heard a long time ago. The text wrote itself in the mind.

*The story of BLACK and WHITE.*

He continued to march the carpet.

*Once upon a time, long and long ago, an Angel desired to create.*
*That is what Angels are born for, yes.*
*But, he, strove to create meaning, entertainment.*

An Inka talked, both embedding the texts into mind and speaking in sound.

*He would grow, eventually becoming the creator to manage the events of everyone's souls.*
*The █████ ██ ████.*

More came along, appearing to each tell a piece of one tale.

*But, that wasn't his dream.*
*He strove to create worlds, meaning.*
*And so, in secret, he began writing.*

*In the mind, a world was made.* 
*One beautiful palace amidst the white plains, a place of all glory.*
*He wrote in the protagonist, their goal, their love, their antagonist.*
*The ink from the pen have been splattered across the pages, and so we were born.*
*A complete story was forged in no time.*

The hallway lightened up, all the doors all around were locked, as if it mattered.

*A Demon came by from the shadows, interested in his works.*
*She'd quickly become his first audience, narrating the tales he wrote.*
*And we, we were the ideas that drove them further.*

*Neither of them knew what struck them, after a long time.*
*Love.*

The end of the hallway has been reached. A door, oddly placed high above close to the ceiling, loomed and begged to be opened. Ferd triggered the gauntlet, he begun to slowly fly upwards to the gate, transparent wings encompassed his back. Entering another layer, another floor, another long hallway. He was pleasantly surprised, the gauntlet began to work just like how everyone described.

*They grew closer, the Angel and the Demon, creating stories together.*
*We listened, watched, laughed, cried, we were their audience.*

*They sought out a place somewhere far, secluded, alone.*
*A planet in the universe lacking color.*
*The fields of white, the mountains of black.*

*Together, with the power of creation and destruction, a palace was built amidst the white plains.*
*All just for us, they said. This is where they'd make their stories come to life, creating their own bubble within the universe for entertainment.*
*Breaking all the testaments.*

*They stopped referring to one as Angels or Demons.*
*They have become the King and the Queen.*
*They both loved chess dearly.*

*This palace was glorious, colorful, with each stroke our forms shift to what we desired.*
*We were not just silhouettes, we were ideas, goals, wishes.*

The birds chirped, but there were no birds, or anything alive nearby.

*Then, their child was born.*
*Ena, the hybrid.*
*The princess, the narrator, our light.*
*All was well.*

Another end of the hallway has been reached, the next corridor blocked by rubble. Ferd, focusing on the gauntlet, turned the ruins into butterflies, and proceeded. The floor was checkered.

*But then, the creator died, the father of all that existed.*
*The Angels outside our bubble writhed, all was in chaos. The order has fallen.*
*Who would create life now?*

*The King, reluctantly deciding to step up. This was an opportunity to grow our stories, our love.*
*A new order, where Angels and Demons could be at peace.*
*A new order, where anyone could be free.*

*Months later, after the storm has calmed.*
*The King and the Queen brought their child with them.*
*We stayed behind, to take care of the palace.*

*…*

*The Angels still followed the old law.*

As Ferd walked on further, the hallway became more cracked, damaged.

*Violent, complete anarchy.*
*With no order set in place, the Angels were no different than Demons.*

*Their speech to set a new rule was cut.*
*The Queen was killed.*
*And with her, the child pronounced 'cursed' followed.*
*The princess shattered, she was lost.*
*The King was left alone, unable to be killed due to the third testament.*

*The King was left alone with nothing.*

The hallway ended, a small door awaited.

*Enraged, grieving, he would destroy them for good.*
*He did not speak to us ever since.*
*He proceeded to create the golden Gauntlet.*

*In a reckless decision, the King had chosen to destroy them all.*
*We were left alone, confused.*
*We have not heard of him ever since.*

*A Prismatic God appeared. Banishing us, erasing our palace for good.*

He opened the door. A grayscale room appeared. Flowers were potted everywhere, paintings and childish drawings were hung on the walls.

*The second prophecy of BLACK and WHITE.*
*The birth of the sacred child.*

*After a botched reconstruction, the Angels and Demons hide in solitude. We, who have been sealed away are freed, taking part of the role for which the creators have failed.*

*Truth is, the second prophecy has never happened.*
*The Kings' story, re-imagined by the Prismatic God, unfinished.*
*It always begins, never ends. The next sacred child is never born, the next wielder of the Gauntlet never becomes a true King. The wrong Inka comes to become the Queen.*
*Once a reconstruction happens, it only loops again.*

*Will you be the one to finally end it?*
*Will you finally finish the Kings' tale?*

After looking at the past memories of the palace, Ferd turns around.

*Will you-*

Masy falls to her knees before even finishing her sentence. The faint music stopped.

"I'm so sorry!" She grabs the floor, "I failed you! I failed her!-" She spoke through her crystal clear tears. 

Ferd just approached her, kneeling down to wrap his arms around her.

"It's okay." He spoke his first words. She hesitantly wrapped her small arms around his back, too.

"I'm scared." Masy spoke to his ear, "I don't know what's going to happen next..."

"It's going to be fine." He smiled at her, accepting the oncoming tragedy. "Masy, thank you for everything. You've done so much, you shouldn't be sorry for anything..."

"Thank you." She wiped the tears off her eyes, "I see you finally figured out the gauntlet, isn't that nice?"

"It doesn't feel like such a burden anymore." He looked at his right hand, "It doesn't..."

"Do you want me to guide you, one final time?" Despite everything, she tried to smile, reaching her hand out to Ferd.

"Would be an honor." He faintly nodded.

He let his left hand be taken by Masy, and they'd proceed to walk through the hallways again. They talked, filling in the silence. He would be guided to the throne room, obscured by a waterfall of light.

"You know..." Masy spoke up, "All those Inkas that told you the tale, none of them were actually there. This will be the first time all of us except our older generations will get to see the battle."

"I didn't expect it to come so soon." He looked down, "I made a few close friends up there, I wish I could tell them my farewells."

After a moment of silence, "You know, Ferd. I'll be there, I'll take care of them."

"I don't deserve you." He nervously chuckled, looking at the falling light at the front of them.

"You're my King, after all." She smiled.

...

"Ena is already waiting behind this wall, right?" He pointed and asked.

She only nodded.

"Well..." He took a deep breath.

"I better get going."
