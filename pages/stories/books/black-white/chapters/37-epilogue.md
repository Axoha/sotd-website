"...The 'Monochrome Era', on this day, is announced to be over!"

"...I'll be your host, Marie Stephanson, the Genkatan is destroyed! The whole monochrome threat is gone! What?!"

The Disobedients' operation on Gen-72 was a major success. The chains, the armies, Vlad and Isaac lay down on the mud in relief. The Citadelarian forces retreat, fireworks are immediately loaded and fired. What once was a planet consisting of only black and white, is now a planet of all color. Fireworks, one after another, light up the night sky with beauty. The war is won. Politics may be messy for the time being, however. Ally roams the peaceful battlefield, holding Rila's glasses close to her chest. She looks up at the beautiful sky with her big eyes, amazed, but still concerned.

"...The Citadel has confirmed to withdraw from all frontlines. A major chunk of their military was bit off after the Genkatan was took down by a seemingly unknown force..."

"...New Babylon officials state the following, 'all operations with the Citadel are terminated from now on, over'..."

Even in the New Babylon, fireworks lit the sky.

"Yo, Houst! What happened?" Bill comes into their room.

"Were you literally not watching." They respond, annoyed.

"No! Ferdinand wasn't a fan of live war footage! It's ridiculous, he had a point. We told Rose off so we can switch the channel to some sports."

"Okay." They groaned, "The Genka died, the Disobedients won the war and eradicated Inka from our existence. Don't talk to Rose for the time being, I guess."

Silence ensues.

"HUH???"

"Boss." They look directly at him, "Please stop."

"Gee fine okay." Offended, he leaves the room. "So serious..." He grumbles away.

"...It has been a day since victory, another major event occurred. No wars, no conflict for the time being, agreed upon many across the universe. Manufacturers are using these confusing times to further develop machinery and weaponry..."

Back on the planet of Onder-5, where the camp of a small Disobedient's group was located, where Ferd and Ena starred for seven years. The fireworks still continued, all the members were ecstatic. Drinking in memory of Lips, the commander, and Ena, the bravest warrior. Ferd was found a while ago with an Inka, who was not Masy, but a muted child. He didn't spend time with the rest of the camp, instead he directly walked with his child to the cliffside where the sun always rises. Where he always sang songs with his love. He brushed Sammy's hair, who was taking in the beautiful sight of the clear night sky, along with the distant fireworks exploding in the background. Ferd was utterly and completely broken inside, but, with just a small greeting.

"Hey."

He looked back to where the line came from. Ally, also not in the best mood, stood. She sat down next to him, her legs hanging from the cliffside. Sammy looked at her with silly curiosity, and soon a conversation grew. He was broken, but not alone.

"...New Babylon announces new changes within its cities, discounts on everything! Tourists claim everything was too expensive..."

Houston walks through the park, same nighttime as somewhere far away. The fireworks have already stopped in the New Babylon. They find their favorite bench, one that held the most beautiful sight of the city, but was still never occupied and secret. It still had its own silly markings drew ages ago by them, and someone else. They sit on the bench, hands in pockets in the chilly weather. They look at the city for a long while before reaching out to their hidden pocket to take out a picture... of someone.

"Larmie... did I do the right thing?"
