The capital ship of the highest Disobedient tier warped into the sky, casting a thick shadow across the sanctuary. Multiple smaller crafts ejected from the capital ship, ready to pick up everyone; all forty scrap allies designated for this camp. Everyone would be judged, everything would change. As the first craft landed and opened its doors, several soldiers wearing the thickest and most advanced armor walked out to escort the first batch. Their faces were obscured by their helmets, breathing heavily through the masks as they watched and observed. It was silent, at least between the allies. Ferd, Houston, and Ally walked together first through the crowd. They all watched, most were disappointed, some refused to look, and surprisingly a few even silently cheered for doing something completely unhinged of course. Ferd was looking down refusing to look at anyone as he was harshly guided by the soldiers into the craft. He was seemingly dead inside, without a word to tell.
During the whole seven years of service, he and Ena both grew close to the heart of the sanctuary. Deaths were surprisingly rare, their strategies with the allies at missions always consisted of sticking together and staying strong, and anyone who'd be wounded would be tended to immediately. They all cared for each other. Ferd and Ena were the most popular and beloved duo, chit-chatting with fellow allies after missions... That's all Ferd could think at the moment inside of the ship.

"Psst, you, white axolotl with the bubbly ponytail." A whisper came next to her, "Who are you? I'm eager to know, you look super cool."

Ally slightly blushed at that remark and softly touched her face in reaction, "Um... Thanks!" She couldn't whisper.

"Keep that for later." Vlad, who was sat right across them with a hulking slouched body grudgingly spoke, "The mood is dead, no need for such chat. I want the silence."

"...Later?" The fellow spoke, "Sir, I don't know if you're realizing this, but we're likely gonna be sent for execution!"

The mention of an execution shook both Ally and Houston, unfamiliar with the Disobedient. They looked at each other, witnessing the same expression on both of their faces.

"I say, with the kindest intention, we eat Ferd alive before we land at the capital." Another fellow spoke up.

"Brother, Ferd may have just doomed us all, but I'm not turning my back on him just like that." And even more voices began to rise, the space quickly split into different opinions and everyone started arguing. Ferd was unresponsive, fidgeting his fingers while looking down.

"*SILENCE*." Vlad yelled out, the whole space suddenly froze and everyone went silent, "I cannot with any of you."

"Yeah I think we've known-"

"*UNITY*, that is what this entire camp was about!" He continued to yell, "Sticking together even during the darkest of times, taking care of one another no matter what. Has everyone here lost their minds?! Even if we were set for execution I believe with my whole heart, that Ferd of all people will guide us to freedom. This *LUNATIC* has slipped through the hands of the *NEW BABYLON*, the strongest known force in the entire darn *UNIVERSE*."

Ferd looked up at Vlad in surprise, who was currently going off.

"...I do not care if he has 'doomed us all'. Blame me for my resistance-ill heart, I will wreck and shred the Disobedient if they go on with their measly 'execution plans', it will simply - not - end - *HERE!* We are brothers and sisters, if they punish us all, we will punish them back. We have the skills, we have the knowledge, we have the experience." And with that, he sat back down, sighing. It can't easily be described to what followed, but amidst the silence everyone began to feel hopeful and inspired. Nobody knew what the gauntlet on Ferd's right arm was about, but after reflecting on his journey, maybe it would become the key for a hopeful future. No one was sure how exactly they would fight against the Disobedient's strongest forces in the main heavily-militarized capital of all places, but there was a fire of optimism in their hearts.

The grand capital ship had finally docked at the brutalist heart of the Disobedient - Lubidvia. Red and yellow tulips littered the sides of the steel walkways with a hint of roses. The concrete skyscrapers loomed above the gray clouds which have covered the skies of the city. The camp marched on, silent. They were led by the heavily-armored soldiers of the capital all the way into the core, which was defined by wire and ominous hallways.
Seven decades ago, the first extraterrestrial war in the whole universe broke out between the Citadel and the Disobedient starting off by an invasion of Earth. It all happened during the late second world war, when the Citadelarians arrived without a warning, without a message, only a hunger for resources and domination. Eighty-percent of the world has perished within just a year, and what remained, united. All the nations joined forces and became the Disobedient, led by an old retired president who was determined to see the Citadel fall. They fought for their freedom against the violent oppression, stealing advanced alien technology to enhance their fighting capabilities. Great battles took place as the lasers and bullets flew in the skies, as the ashes and smoke rose to obscure the sunlight, as the humans mourned their losses with the will to fight for a better future. The old man, the president, became the director. He wanted to see the fires of their victory, the celebrations of a desired day. It was a wish, to see all of his enemies fall. As the decades went by his body progressively changed into machine and wire, he would command the highest researchers to let him live on, to not die until the Citadel would fall.
The assembly hall, deep within the heart of Lubidvia, where the only light came from gray-stained windows. The old man resided at the top of a pillar, fueled by machines, his body was holding onto a frail string of life as his skin deteriorated and freshened itself as he breathed. All forty members of the camp were forcefully pushed into an open space right at his sight. Ferd was at the front, along with the two criminals he's been with.

"...Ferd Ray..." The director's weak voice echoed through the hall, he raised a finger to point at him, "...get me my pills."

The whole group was confused. No one had seen or met him before, and now, only his hands and voice were visible from the deep shadow. Ferd hesitantly nodded, he stepped forward onto a path he assumed was the way to the top. He walked a flight of steep stairs, and after an awkward exercise where his footsteps echoed, he reached the top. There was a round wooden table next to the director, on which a special case with golden pills inside stood. He took it with his left hand, placing it onto his right palm of the gauntlet, and he slowly fumbled the opening. He managed to snag a pill, putting the case back onto its place. A single pill laid on his right palm as he got a fancy glass of water on his left hand. He slowly made his way to the director's chair.

"...terrible, terrible!" The directors hands reached out to frustration, taking the pill and water, "So obedient, disgusting, treacherous!"

After he swallowed the pill and drank all the water, he tossed the glass aside, shattering it across the floor, "...absolutely shameful behavior, from someone who had turned everything against us!"

Ferd had nothing to say, he backed away in fear and confusion as the director continued to point fingers directly at him. The whole camp stood at the bottom, watching.

"...I find you perfect." The director calmed after a short silent moment, "...You truly captured what it is to be disobedient, even in that slight short moment. Troops like you are unsuitable, dangerous in such era, and cannot go unpunished in this system."

Ferd felt under pressure, stressed, but he did a swell job of hiding it and acting neutral.

"...one month..." The director raised his finger, turning his face to the people of the camp, "...a rift had opened, tearing the forces of every nation in the cosmos apart. We do not understand why, we do not understand how, but it is only clear, that sparkling gauntlet... I am giving you one month, kill the beast. You will be given an endless supply of weapons and resources to accomplish the mission, but failure will bring nothing but completely annihilation."

Everyone was surprised, even the soldiers of the capital. Houston didn't have anything extra to express. The group felt slightly relieved, no executions, no overthrowing the government. After some more time of his speech they were let go to wander the capital for a few hours before they'd be extracted back into the sanctuary... they decided to spend their time at a restaurant.

"How's it feel being the main character?" Ally nudged at Ferd as they and Houston were sat at one table, "Whole ordeal was pretty awkward, no big deal amirite?"

"Huh, yeah, was pretty okay." He held his right arm, "I can't help but wonder how things will go, I'm certainly not looking forward to hunting my Ena throughout the cosmos." He said with a frown.

"You know, I believe she won't be as violent on the next encounter." She took a sip, suppressing her silly side, "I think it'll go well and may be over faster than we think, from what I've been hearing you and Ena were like possessed for each other, and there won't be any snarky guardians around either."

"Yeah..." A slight hint of a smile appeared on his face.

Houston looked at both of them with a suspicious look as they were carefully eating their meal, "You two seem so close, eh? Barely leavin' enough space for me!" They smirked, swinging on a chair again.

"Right, sorry, just nothing has been coming up. I'm not the chatty one." Ferd took the fork with his left hand and started eating, struggling to cut the food as he couldn't use his right arm for such dexterous acts.

"Man, I don't know you well enough." Ally scratched her chin, "I always wondered how you even came around to find us, wouldn't you be locked up in the depths of the New Babylon or something?"

"Oh, nah, I wasn't even caught!" They chuckled, "It may have looked like it, but I managed to sneak my way through to the Disobedient to catch up with Ferd."

"Impressive." She sipped on her drink. Ferd was still struggling to cut up the meat with a fork. "Need help with that?" She asked, tilting her head. Ferd just nodded, leaning on his back in defeat as Ally proceeded to cut the meat with a knife. Houston couldn't help but just look at both of them with envy.

After a long day of briefings with his commander Lips, he laid in bed taking up the whole mattress. Everyone was busy recently, he wondered when the next mission would finally come. The relations between him and the rest of the sanctuary were tethered, but it wasn't as bad this time around. From the shadows, under the moon's rays, Masy has manifested once more.

"Ferd." She spoke, "It has been a while!"

"Yeah." He wasn't all that surprised anymore, completely lost in thought.

"Things are shaping up to be nicer, but I will be busy, too busy, the queen demands a lot." She shook her head, "I'm relieved I got you into the prophecy, it never made sense to me for that 'Bill' to be the one with the gauntlet."

"Is that why?" He asked, confused.

"The queen shouldn't have been acting like this." She said, looking down, "Seeing her like that, maybe I want to change the prophecy, I want to see both of you happy. I can't imagine what the New Babylon would've been doing if it were for Bill and a different trio to confront the queen!"

"I hope she's still somewhere in there." He mumbled to himself in a concerned tone, "I'll always love her, even if she is some monstrous being."
