A dream broadcasting device was mounted and turned on. With brutally loud ear screeching noises, a cursor appeared on a black screen with mind-numbing static noise. Rose stood in the silent room, watching with utmost curiosity as the cursor morphed into a pixelated boy with a pair of wings at the reflection of his eye.

"Hello *また* again *こんにちは.*"

The heart walks up to the voice.

"What brings you here today, just like any other day? *今日はいつものように、なぜここに来たのですか?*"

Swinging its one free arm back and forth, a statue spoke without moving its mouth.

"Silent yet again, hm? *また沈黙してるね?*"

"My little red rascal, I cannot offer more help. I am sorry, my knowledge has its limits. *小さな赤い天使さん、これ以上のお手伝いはできません。申し訳ありませんが、私の知識には限界があります.*"

"Maybe step up to the door on my left, hm? Maybe you will finally find an answer there. *左手のドアまで行ってみたらどう? もしかしたら、そこで答えが見つかるかもしれないよ.*"

The heart turned to the right and walked.

"Being disobedient is now in your nature, hm? Are you finally letting the ？？？？seep into your soul? *不従順なのが君の性分になってしまったのか？ついに器が魂に染み込んでしまったのか?*"

The screen turned black as the heart walked out of the room, and with a simple fading black transition he appeared in a long hallway. 

"Hey, wait up!"

"Yeah, where are you going?"

Two entities appear, roughly the same size of the pixelated boy.

"You don't want to do this alone, do you?"

"It's all been leading up to this, hasn't it?"

The heart continues to walk, together with the two closest friends.

"Is it not crazy that it ends right here?"

"After all the adventures we've been through..."

The heart continues to walk, together with the two closest friends.

"I am going to miss it."

"But it'll be worth it for her, right?"

The boy continues to walk, together with the two closest friends.

"You will still be with us, right?"

"I can't imagine living without you."

The boy continues to walk, and so they have reached the room. The gauntlet was displayed on a pedestal, untouched, glorious. Rose and the crew in the room were bewildered by the sight, a first time the gauntlet itself appeared in the dream. He rushed to take out his notebook to begin writing.

"Is this the part where we say goodbye?"

"What's your next choice?"

The seventh gauntlet has been equipped.

"At least, could you?"

"Manifestation, you are?"

"Something say!"

"Have never we heard you before speak!"

Gain experience points.

The two entities wanted to say more, but nothing came out. The boy approached them, and with a normal interaction they were both deleted. The boy gained levels, the two closest friends are gone. The boy walked into another room, which was populated by small pixelated black bears with long glowing white hair, Inkas.

A text slowly wrote itself,
*The second prophecy of BLACK and WHITE*
*The birth of the sacred child*

The boy proceeded to go from room to room, interacting with Inkas to erase them from the dream. Each lost wish, each lost child, each erasure granted the boy experience points. He grew, and he would grow.

Another text slowly wrote itself,
*After the botched reconstruction, the Angels and Demons hide in solitude. The Inkas who have been sealed away are freed, taking part of the role for which the creators have failed.*

More Inkas would get erased. The moving sprites tried to escape, but none could get away from the boy.

The texts slowly wrote themselves,
*The King will come to rise alongside the Queen, the previous sacred child.*
*A tender and deep relationship will grow.*
*Do you really believe its only the second time?*

Once the boy has earned enough, a black hand reached out to his small body.

"I am all alone, there is nothing here anymore."
"I am all alone, everyone around me I erased."

The boy must face the final obstacle. An orb appears, three times the size of the boy.

"Okay, Ally." Houston cleared their throat, "I've already told you a bunch 'bout your body, right? Why you're pale, why you feel stronger, all cause a guardian gave its life to you!"

"I think I knew that." She shrugged it off, "Get to the main point!"

"Try conjuring something! Open up your palm, raise your hand into the sky, think of something to grab!" They urged her.

Without question but a raised eyebrow, she did so. After a short moment, dust swirled around her palm and suddenly she got ahold of flowers.

"Wonderful, least that works. Granted you have absolutely no combat experience, no knowledge of anything, we'll make this work somewhat I guess!" They sighed.

"I could do this the whole time and you didn't even tell me?!" She was confused, leaning into the mad feeling.

"I..." They stammered, "I... forgot."

"Whatever." She scoffed, grabbing their arm and darting off into the first empty hallways of Tartarus. The surface layer of this facility wasn't heavily guarded, the labyrinth has been doing all its work.

A Citadelarian laid back on a comfy chair in a clean looking security room, surrounded by screens all over to monitor most of their tasked sector. They held coffee, even though Citadelarians couldn't drink, it felt nice to swirl the fluid inside and hold the warm mug. The screen broadcasts turned to static, one by one, slowly. It caught the officer off guard, but they didn't react in any crazy way, all they did was just open up a command prompt on their main computer.

They held the coffee close to their face as they looked at the screens. It was hard to tell, before they could be clearly shown both of them threw something directly at the camera to cut the signal off. The officer was starting to get annoyed, all they needed to know were the numbers at the back of their jumpsuits.

"No Houston, we are not finding our stuff first!" She snapped, sliding around the corners manifesting daggers to take out the security cameras. Whenever she tried throwing them, she'd miss most of the time.

"My bag! I got some of my most important belongings there! Lord knows what they could be doing to it!" They were desperate, hinting sadness.

"Your things are the least of concern here." She was frustrated, "Teach me more-"

Suddenly, all the ambient noise stopped, a bright white beam emitted from the top of the labyrinth. The light froze, and from it broke out the giant - the Genkatan. The fragments of the collapsing beam broke down into small dust particles, and with a sudden impact the Genkatan crushed down to take a closer look. They both froze, the giant stared at them with odd curiosity using its six dotted white eyes.

The officer proudly sighed, taking a sip of the coffee... spilling it all over themselves. The current sector at which the duo was stranded on began to move, the Genkatan stood back on its two legs and its right arm defined by black spikes began to wildly charge. Thunderstorms crackled, they both ran for their lives to hide behind a wall.

"Houston Houston TELL ME WHAT MORE I CAN DO WITH THIS!" She grabbed both of their shoulders and yelled directly at their face.

"You can... You can...!" Before they could speak, a massive beam erupted from the Genkatan's arm, melting everything in its path right besides them both. "You can change your physical properties! Phase through objects, stick to walls, melt into whatever! It's extremely dangerous!"

"One last thing." She took a deep breath, "I'll ask again, what's the most likely place to find Ferd."

"In the deeper layers, I don't know! We should head for the main elevator chamber of this sector." They pointed with their thumb to a general direction. Ally looked over their shoulder, the gaping hole in the ground was perfect. She couldn't help it, a devious smile grew on her face.

She ran off to the middle of an open area, in the direct sight of the Genkatan. Waving her hands in the air, producing some sort of sparkly material from her fingertips as Houston sneakily climbed down into the deeper layers through the freshly melted hole. The Genkatan felt nothing, it formed a fist with its left hand and struck the sector with formidable force which Ally barely managed to blitz out of. The giant was faster to strike than expected, its right arm began to crackle with lightning again. Ally leapt at a wall within the gaping wound on the floor, getting to stick on the steel surface, but quickly sliding down immediately. Houston waited at the bottom, and out of nowhere Ally finally tumbled over to their feet.

"What did you even try to do up there?" They raised an eyebrow.

"A distraction." She rubbed her face, "Hope that helped!"

Their chatter was immediately disrupted by the Genkatan's massive laser beam. There was no time to waste right now, that made it clear.

"How interesting." Rose's whole body trembled, staring at the dream broadcast without blinking. "I need to know more, we need to know more."

The text slowly wrote itself,
*Once the child is born, the worlds are saved.*

The whole room suddenly shook, "What the hell could all this commotion be about!?"

"Doc, there are two identified prisoner escapees. The Genkatan is after them, they will be rid off in no time." A nearby Citadelarian spoke up, busy checking any and all updates from Tartarus.

"Oh, let her do things, just tell her to be quieter!" He gestured with a hand, annoyed.

As the boy walked circles in the broadcast, Rose waited to sense another tremble. "Perfect." Satisfied that its calm, he got back to watching.

Houston and Ally ran from the Genkatan who has now fully assimilated with the darkness. Crawling on all fours, squeezing through the tight space of the deeper layer, Ally observed its movement and began to crawl on the walls like a lizard. She'd occasionally fumble and slip but with each step she got better, accidentally tearing off pieces of her skin on the palm as she climbed. The Genkatan would often open its mouth, firing smaller beams at a general direction of those two. Each one would melt a piece of the interior, perfect for absolutely breaking the maze.

The shaking got intense again, "Wha- I told you to turn her down!" Rose was furious, the broadcast being interrupted by each impact above.

"Doc, turning it down more is gonna render 'her' completely useless. It is already taking a long while-"

"HUSH! Shh!" He silenced the whole room, the broadcast stopped.

Ferd moved, flailing on the ground.

"Initiate a trial?" A Citadelarian quietly asked.

"No!" Rose snapped at them.

Ferd's gauntlet shone again, glimmering in the cold darkness of the room. He felt the mind leaving him, and suddenly, he felt ethereal. Without gravity to bind him he slowly flew into the air, his gauntlet shined brighter than ever. He could see everything, the stars, the planets, the moons. The stellar constellations, the galaxies, the black holes. Everything was at the palm of his right hand, all the memories came by like a wave, clashing onto the beach at an inconsistent sequence. He called out for Masy, Ally, Houston, and Ena, his voices echoing throughout the space, but no one came around.

*"I am all alone, there is nothing here anymore."*
*"I am all alone, everyone around me I erased."*

In a blinding flash, he disappeared from the cell. He reappeared at the lowest level of Tartarus, the most secured containment chamber within the universe.
