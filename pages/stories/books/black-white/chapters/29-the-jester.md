With a hint of hesitation, Ferd sunk his left hand into the water. The butterflies flew upwards, and together with their wings they formed a text in the darkness. The stained glass changing depending on the phrase that is spelled.

*The tale in the hands of those banished.*
*The foretelling of the Inka, the second story of BLACK & WHITE.*

*After the botched reconstruction, the Angels and Demons hide in solitude.*
*The Inka who have been sealed away are freed, taking part of the role for which the creators have failed.*
*With bells chiming, a new time coming, the birth of the second sacred child is fast approaching.*

*Two lovers, the King and the Queen.*
*The King will come to rise alongside the Queen, the previous sacred child.*
*But lo, such feat is not achieved, the Queen disappears and the King is left to be.*

*The spirits from a time long gone guide the King. In a place of shadow, the divine trio are united.*

*The VESSEL, a substitute for LOVE. Named King by the Inka, an naïve soldier blindly following the hands of fate.*
*The embodiment of HOPE, referred to as the Knight. A survivor who rejects the harshness of the worlds, carving their own path despite any and all difficulty.*

"That's me!!!" Ally quietly squealed, pointing fingers at the stained glass.

*And at last... the Jester.*

*They will meet the darkness, covering each other's side.*
*They will meet the Warrior, named the strongest Guardian of them all.*
*They will confront the Queen together, the monochrome world destroyed.*
*They will chase the beast of screens at the edge of the cosmos.*
*They will encounter the Rook, the WALL, a false manifestation of the Inka. Their journey put to a halt, the trio divided.*

The butterflies stopped forming text, it seemed to be at its end. Ferd was speechless, Houston busy taking note, Ally was in awe again.

"There has to be more, right?" Houston questioned.

"Yes, yes." Masy nodded, "The prophecy is changing so much, none of us know why! I helped write some of these alongside my big old sisters. Ferd, try putting your hand back in."

And he did, more lines appeared.

*The original texts, a climax revolving around an execution, erased.*
*At last, the Caretaker will be summoned.*
*The trio, together with the Queen and the Prophet will forge a deal with the Caretaker.*
*A new order, the new prophecy will be cemented in place.*
*A future of love, of hope, of laughter.*
*A tale never complete, reaching its end.* 
*Finally, the Monarch fully comes to be. The King and Queen's love united, their child born.*

"The prophecy about changing times..." Masy softly spoke, "The Queen told me to change the tale, and so I did everything I possibly could. We all agreed to this alteration, we refuse to live another tale where the King is forced to execute their lover. I have not lived through the previous prophecies, but, I refuse to live through such tragedy-"

Her long speech was interrupted by Ferd's tight hug, "Thank you."

A sweet sight, the ominous tone of the room turned more hopeful. Masy had nothing to say, in return she just hugged him back. Ally spent some time looking at them, before her eyes darted to the bowl. With wonder, she sunk her hand in the water.

*The embodiment of HOPE, referred to as the Knight. A survivor who rejects the harshness of the worlds, carving their own path despite any and all difficulty.*
*The purest soul, full of kindness and joy. The Knight is there for the King and the Jester, bringing up the spirits of the trio during their travels.*

"Huh." She thought it was nice, "Houst, go give it a try, your description was kinda wack."

"I don't think I want to..." They were busy writing down notes.

"Don't be so silly." She grabbed their arm to tug them in, "Right here, c'mon."

"If you insist." They shook their head, sinking their right hand into the water.

*And at last... the Jester.*

The stained glass behind cracked with a loud strike, the butterflies formed unintelligible phrases before flying away. Everyone was left speechless, the hopeful tone was crushed and torn instantly.

"...What was that about?" Houston nervously chuckled, "Is it not written yet??"

Masy struggled to say something, "I... don't know." She looked towards the stained glass, "It probably just hasn't been written yet."

"I hope so!" Ally was worried, "I don't like what that was implying! No! No way!"

"We can go ask my old siblings." Masy came up with an idea, looking at the trio, "They know more than I do, they've written most of the new tale!"

The group all agreed, they walked down the stairs to be led by Masy again. The slow serious walk through the dimly lit hallways sped up, until Ally struck a nerve.

"Can me and Houston talk privately for a moment." She asked.

"Uh, sure?" Ferd was confused.

"Right, follow me." She dragged Houston to a nearby room and closed the door.

"Um, Ally, what's all this about?" They weren't too nervous, a growing concern appeared on their face.

"Houst..." She spoke, "You better not die."

Their eyes widened, "Hey, relax. It's more than likely just a mistake on their end."

"Houston... I've lost so much already." Her hope was dwindling, she was shaking, grabbing their jacket, "I've lost my family, I've lost my closest friends, I've lost my lover, I don't know how much more I can take."

"I'll be here, all's gonna be okay." They brushed her hair with a hand, speaking softly, but worried.

"I saw you slowly distance yourself ever since the prison! In the Babylon you barely came around to chat! You know more than I do, more about the old tales and such. Please, look me directly in the eyes and promise that you are not going to die." Her eyes were teary and wide. 

Houston looked directly at her, giving her a tight hug and resting their head on her. "I won't leave, it'll be okay. I promise"

"...So that's what the Caretaker is." Masy was busy explaining stuff to Ferd, "Another thing is, you are aware of all those hints about the unfinished tale? Apparently all the previous prophecies have failed, the Queen was killed but the child never born! Who knows how long ago the first prophecy was, the second one was never successful..." She shook her head.

"Seems it was long due for a rewrite." He replied.

The door nearby finally opened. Ally and Houston both came out shaken, pretending nothing wrong happened (it was obvious). They continued the march, reaching a spacious reflective room from which chandeliers hung at various heights and lows. Unusually, no old Inka was there, just a single guardian humming and floating at the middle. 

"Um, hi." Masy opened up, "Could you tell us where our old sisters currently are?"

As an unintelligible conversation occurred in an unknown language, Houston looked to the back of the room. An opening, a glint, a shadow. They panicked.

"Target set." Before Houston could say anything, a sniper rifle was fired, its shot loud and echoing. Everyone's ears rang, the Guardian's head was furiously bleeding. Dizzily floating around, everyone in utter panic, the Guardian frantically looked at any spot before deciding to open its chest and let out a booming roar. All the lit candles extinguished, all the light gone, silence. Masy was in absolute shock, extending her little arms to signal the trio to back away before they all fell into the darkness. They rushed to one of the many balconies of the cathedral, and soon a flashing white beam permeated the snow outside. All the Inkas and Guardians hid, an emergency was called. Skinny boney hands suddenly crashed through the ground, pulling the beast's whole body to the surface. After its legs stomped upon the snow, and its head was out of the abyss, it let out a guttural roar to warn any living being of its presence.

"Oh no, no no no, too soon!!!" Masy was in disbelief, "We need to hide, RIGHT NOW!"

"What is that thing!?" Ally spoke with fear.

"That's... a demon, the Caretaker..." She looked down, "If we hide, there is a good chance we won't need to confront her! We are-"

The giant beast opened its hand and a flashing light blinked at its palm. Multiple white, detailed eyes appeared on its pure black skin. Before they knew it a beam of light was fired at their general location.

"She sees us." Masy was horrified, tugging at the clothes of the trio. They all ran into the quiet cathedral with the Caretaker slowly crawling onto the building, each grip destroying and corrupting small pieces of the palace.

"Whoever that sniper was, we all agreed to call the biggest sister whenever they showed up again..." Masy hid in the shadows, become one with it, "She's a force, hungry. An actual demon, not an Inka. She thinks we're at fault!"

The Caretaker's hands crashed through the ceiling, ash and dust obscuring their sight. Her patience ran too low scouring for ants, with a smash she struck down the cathedral to be split in two. With a bare evasion, Houston was now separated from Ally and Ferd.

"HOUSTON!!!" She cried out, "Are you okay!?"

They grunted and coughed, "Yes, yes I am." All the way at the other half of the palace. "Go! I can take care of myself!"

She had mixed feelings, but they needed to move right away. With a quick request, she urged Masy to go with Houston. The whole cathedral shook from the inside, Ferd grabbed Ally's arms and rushed away together. Running through a flight of spiral stairs, the Caretaker took an interest in Ferd, the only being in the whole area wielding a weapon capable of harm. She continued to jab her hands through the building, tearing down walls, destroying everything in its path. Ferd punched each fist that came near, proving surprisingly effective, forcing her to pull her hand away. Her arms extruded bubbles, the dozens of eyes followed the duo. At the top of the stairs was nothing but the grand bell, along a sight of the entire underworld dimly lit. The Caretaker, who has been clinging to the cathedrals side stood up and ominously loomed above the duo.

Ally pointed a finger at the giant, "L-Look! I'm not scared! I-I faced beasts like you before, y-you certainly *WILL* regret t-this!" She stuttered, her hand shook.

She only laughed, extending its multiple arms from its body. Her body was undefined.

"I h-have Ferd by my side!" Drops of sweat ran through her face, "You will lose! You got that?! You will lose!"

It turned dark, oh so dark, Ferd and Ally valiantly stood against the Caretaker with her face high up at the ceiling of this world. They pressed against their ears as she roared, all her hands shimmering with light to charge beams. 

"Ally." He turned to her, "Grab my legs, throw me at the bell!"

"W-What??!" She was utterly confused.

"I can swim in the air! I can reject gravity with my gauntlet, remember!" He formed a fist with his right hand, and soon his gauntlet started to shine and his whole body felt lighter. She got the memo right away, grabbing both of his legs and spinning around to gain just enough momentum to strike the bell. Once she let go, he flew to the bell at blitz speeds and dented it, causing it to ring devastatingly loudly. Such noise interrupted the Caretaker, misfiring all her charges. She roared in frustration, clawing at the building. Ally saw potential, she leapt at one of her hands and clung to it. She moved slowly, but the winds were fierce. Ally held onto her finger with a whole dear life, slowly clawing her way onto her limb. With each eye she came along, she raised a hand to create a sparkler to stab it with. Ferd continued to ring the bell down at the cathedral, distracting the Caretaker before she'd get a chance to do something against Ally. Once Ally got to the Caretaker's face, she clung to her forehead and laid a hand directly on her eye to produce fireworks off of her fingertips. The Caretaker recoiled, covering her face, such quick reflex threw her off the face and she was quickly plummeting down to the palace. Ferd swam in the air, just barely managing to catch her arms. Safely going down, they both looked at each other while the Caretaker was weeping with a covered face.

"Now... throw me at her." He said with a determined expression.

Ally was shook from everything, but despite everything, she managed to smile and nod. Getting ready for another throw, she grabbed his legs and he began to float, until suddenly-

"STOP IT!!! DON'T KILL HER!!!" Masy cried out, exhausted. She'd proceed to step in front of the duo, stand at the ledge of the cathedral, and tiredly speak in unintelligible language. The Caretaker would lean down, it's face - mainly eyes were heavily damaged.

"She is dangerous and menacing, but she's still a part of our family." She turned back to Ally and Ferd, "I don't blame anyone, this is all a massive misunderstanding."

"I didn't know that would kill her." Ferd honestly spoke up, his eyes gliding away.

Masy continued to speak with the Caretaker, peacefully. Ally and Ferd sat down to catch their breath, looking at the two grand beings no one would believe were real.

"This wasn't supposed to happen so soon." She turned back to them, "But, it seems with the Caretaker confrontation over, the new prophecy will be put in charge..." She sighed in relief.

The darkness faded, all seemed well, until a charge was heard from behind. A ball of light was shot, piercing directly through the Caretaker's forehead. Her body tumbled over the ledge, collapsing on the snow down below. The group looked back, and all they saw was Houston carrying a special cannon in their hands, tossing it away.

"W-Why...?!" Ally, with terror in her eyes quietly spoke.

They looked down, "I had to."
