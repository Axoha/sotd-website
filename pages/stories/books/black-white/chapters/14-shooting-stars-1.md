*A few days later... after a lot of boring snoozing around.*

"Ally, what in the world are these noises I'm hearin'?" Houston came over to her, alluded by the strange goofy coin noises coming from Ally's cellphone.

"Ah, dude, that's mega jump!" She glanced over at him for a short moment before turning her focus back on the game, tilting her phone left and right, "Ages ago I found this old phone in the heaps of scrap and it worked! Had some games 'installed', this one's my favorite!"

Houston leant closer to the phone, they were confused, "Damn, so choppy."

"Choppy?" She paused the game, tilting her head facing Houston, "Choppy?! This runs beautifully compared to most thingamabobs I used before!"

"I feel like you would explode if you'd get your grubby hands on something from the Babylon." They arrogantly spoke like a nerd.

Ally just looked at them with a frowned look. "Try it out, I wanna see you suck ass at it."

"Challenge... accepted." They were surprised, gently taking the phone from her hands, "Haven't held one of these in forever, they've been becomin' obsolete as of late."

"You rich people boggle my mind." She rolled her eyes. Houston instinctively tapped on the 'START' button. "Bro, not even waiting for me to explain the game?" Ally grew confused.

"Nah." They smirked, "Seems easy enough."

Once the game has finished loading, a small blue penguin stood at the bottom of the screen on a grass field within a forest. The game immediately opened up with 'GET SET!' and 'GO!', the penguin launched into the sky to be at the center of the screen, surrounded by coins to propel the little character further into the skies.

"Oh, that little penguin? That's Pepper, I love her!" She smiled, nudging her way to Houston's cheek to get a better view of the game. They were fumbling horrendously, totally not internally panicking as they harshly tilted the phone left and right to steer to bounce off the coins.

"Hah, you fell." She covered her mouth with a hand and chuckled.

"Nope, watch this." They confidently spoke as they pressed the retry button.

The quick countdown started, turning the phone into landscape mode. The small penguin accelerated faster and faster to a locked direction, going at ludicrous speeds where it would be impossible to miss a coin once it started. They seemed proud of themselves, everything seemed to work to plan, until a massive ceiling of anvils spawned and ended the cheese.

"I'm done." Houston gently gave her the phone back, "This game feels too primitive for me."

Ally looked at them, unimpressed. With a quick nab she grabbed the phone and put it into her back pocket, "Jeez, everything's too old and poor for you."

"Well, yeah?!" They opened up, "I grew up in the richest corner of the universe miss!"

"I hate wealthy people like you!" She crossed her arms, staring at them with a grumpy expression, "I can't trust you, seriously. Even after you saved my life I have had some *UNPLEASANT* experience with corporate overlords. You can't even take off those gloves you keep wearing around, you're too afraid your fancy-ass is gonna get their hands dirty!"

Houston looked at their hands and then slowly at her, seemingly growing a tad agitated, "Don't say that."

"Well, prove me wrong." She arrogantly smiled, reaching her hand out to Houston.

They slowly and gently took one of their leather gloves off. Their hand hovered above her palm, hesitant to the point of shaking. She rolled her eyes and tightly clasped their hand. 

"*EEEEEKKKK!!!*" Houston shrieked, immediately sliding their hand from the grip. They frantically rubbed their slimy hand with the taken-off glove, feeling unfathomably uncomfortable. She burst out laughing, which went on for too long to the point of rolling on the floor.

"These rookies, eh, they seem fun." Isaac spoke from a distance, polishing his beloved rocket launcher.

"I wouldn't really call them rookies." Ferd scratched his chin, "They seem experienced with everything, really."

"Not with the Disobedient forces, not with a scrap planet like Onder." He shook his head, "Before I came around with Vladimir, we were as experienced, but it was still a massive change and un-comfy shock. Much more restrictive, but all's worth the metal we get..."

"Uh-huh." Ferd nodded.

"...I wanted to say, by the way." He looked up to the sky, "Impressive job on somehow not getting all of us to slave away at a much higher intensity, even after all your rancid activity, thanks."

He just looked at him, internally confused whether he was being sarcastic or not. Everyone would soon be called to the headquarters of their camp, where all the missions are briefed and assigned. Houston, Ally, and Ferd found their chairs and squeezed next to each other, Ferd being in the middle between them both. Lips, the great commander, stood next to a board that was swiftly lit by a loud projector. She was dressed in a black uniform, contrary to the usual deep Disobedient red.

"Right, pops, our first mission has finally arrived." She proudly presented bulky self, stretching before turning serious, "Everyone is involved, no one stays home. We are officially no longer a part of the Disobedient, we have all been given black attire to designate ourselves as the group to terminate the threat. We will still be supplied by the Disobedient, as told, anything we need and want at our disposal."

Chatter rose among the crowd, mostly positive comments.

"SILENCE!" She yelled out before coughing into a fist and continuing her briefing, "The threat named the 'Queen' has been ravaging the cities and factories of numerous planets of any faction in a seemingly random pattern. All the ruined regions of hit planets are left colorless, and the things and laws that reside there may not make any sense at all. Our first mission is to investigate and research a monochrome region, collect samples, and figure the pattern of the queen..."

Ally raised her hand, giddy to ask something.

"...Yes?" She raised an eyebrow.

"Can I bring the Ant?!" She squealed, "I know how to operate that thing!"

"...Sure." Lips replied, awkwardly

"We don't do that here." Ferd smiled and shook his head, whispering, "Don't count on being able to operate that thing alone."

Ally's excitement faded into a sad little frown.

"...as I was saying." She continued, "GEAR UP, THEY'RE COMING FOR US IN AN HOUR! GET OUTTA HERE!"

Her sudden commands startled the whole crowd and everyone ran off to their homes like bugs. Everyone received special equipment minutes later, from general gear to clothing, everything was so much more advanced than what they've been using for almost a decade. So rich, so comfy, so deadly. Once the higher-Disobedient ships began to descend onto their landing strip everyone stood in a straight line in a firm pose, except for Ally, who was busy scratching her arm. She was nudged by Houston, and after some silent convincing she gave in. They all boarded the ships and flew off into space.

The most recently hit planet, Zuma II, was an obscure planet inhabited by wastelanders. Several of its continents turned gray, the global temperature decreased rapidly, the world was empty and declining. The ship descended through the thick atmosphere, the fog being so dense that navigation was only possible with frequent scans of the surface. The ship managed to land at the heart of a ruined middle-class city, the fog at the concrete ground wasn't surprisingly as bad. They all stepped out of the ships, curiously looking around.

"You know what to do, team." Lips gestured with her hand, "*WB-131's* will be dropped by in a minute."

Many have already settled, implanting scanners to retrieve data from whatever they found. Black spikes reminiscent of obsidian glass, black reflective liquids that were commonly found everywhere within the holes of the asphalt streets, and the snow, that likely wasn't even snow. A minute has passed and the gravity slightly changed to be higher, bearing some extra uncomfortable weight on everyone. Ferd, Ally, and Houston were huddled together, awaiting the Ants to finally come by.

"Ow..." She was vocal about her troubles, "My knees hurt so bad."

"Nothin' makes sense here, the commander was right." Houston looked around the skyscrapers which its tops were obscured by the fog. They held and tapped their device, taking pictures of anything interesting. Ferd, with nothing to do in mind, laid on the strange snow and started making a snow angel. Both of them looked at him with surprise, and it wasn't long before Ally threw herself on the floor and made one next to him. Houston, bothered by their seemingly close relationship, also joined in and made one, right before they were interrupted by a loud slam. The strong gravity pulled the Big Ant onto the ground very harshly, the impact sinking it slightly deep into the concrete. Some screamed at the damage it caused for the Ant's legs, and soon another would be dropped, their scrappy repaired one from their sanctuary. The gravity has unpredictably changed again, this time being much lower. The Ant was dropped and it descended down onto the streets like feather, landing so gently that left many utterly confused. The sight of the Ant triggered something within Ally, she sprinted and jumped at the walker with the lower gravity, climbing its legs to reach the entrance and begin operating. Crowds formed around the walker, impressed, a ladder came down from the Ant as usual to aid others into getting in. In the meantime a portable satellite dish was installed to upload all the data they have collected so far. Ally began to move with the Big Ant once enough people got in, she clumsily made her way towards the one sunk in the ground. She performed an unusual maneuver to tackle the other Ant, simply getting it unstuck. The Ant wouldn't tip over anyway, they were built to automatically make sure they stay on all four legs at all times, even if they were turned off.
Once the other walker had its own crew, the whole group was split in half. Each group would go into different directions with their Big Ant, keeping contact and giving each other two hours to complete their expedition. They told farewell to one another, and set off to walk in the desolate ashy wastelands.

The gravity continued to change, either making them go faster or slower. Ally, Ferd, Houston, Vlad, and Isaac were at the head of the walker, doing absolutely nothing because Ally was too experienced with this sort of stuff. Pressing buttons, navigating the system, the rest of the other half was at the main body of the walker, playing harmonicas and makeshift drums. There was nothing but fierce winds and a dense fog outside... a signal of a heartbeat was sensed.
