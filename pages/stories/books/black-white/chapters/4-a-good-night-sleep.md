"So." Isaac asked, "What did I miss?"

Everyone was sat, unwilling to speak and bored. The ship they were currently on was shaking, experiencing some mild turbulence. They were headed back to the frontline planets to secure resources and safety, just another really average mission, except this time they were bundled with many other allies as well. It was unusual for them to go on a mission a week after the last one.

"Nothing." Someone spoke up amidst the silence. "Everything is still the same."

Ena curiously looked around the interior of the ship. Ferd had his same unamused look, resting his chin on his arm. The ship landed with a loud slam, and the doors slowly opened. Everyone grabbed their gear and rushed into the outside.

They weren't aware it would be so dark.

Multiple allies came unprepared for the night times, squads have been formed around the extraction point as everyone borrowed and turned on their flashlights. There were blinking green lights in the far distance, obviously alluding to a Citadelarian tower.

"It's been a while since we were deployed during the night..." Ferd would wonder, looking up at the starry night, "I can't lie, the dark kind of freaks me out."

"Aw, want me to hold your hand? Guide you through the night?" Ena would mockingly surround Ferd, speaking in a cutesy voice.

Vladimir rudely looked towards them as he put on a pair of thick dark-red goggles. Isaac crawled over his body to sit on his shoulder, right besides his wooly eastern-themed hat. Several whistles were heard from the sky, with red lights and black silhouettes appearing to drop off vehicles for the mission to properly begin. The ground was illuminated by a sudden harsh light, with more appearing in an unorganized sequence. Each dropship appeared to drop off vehicles, the ships themselves looking way more modern and sleek than the machines they had to use. With a loud thundering slam, the last machine was dropped off by a special dropship, it was the beloved *WB-131 "Big Ant"*. As the name suggested, it was a massive walker with its main body shaped similarly to an ant, paired with only four tall and bulky legs. Its head was equipped with four machine-guns and one big odd eye that served no purpose, its main body held a massive artillery cannon that required precise and careful reloading. Its yellow lights lit up with a powerful clack, barely exposing its true form in the darkness.

"Man, if only it were day to see such beauty." Isaac would scoff while crossing his arms.

"If we are not reckless and destroy it within the first few minutes, there is a small possibility we keep it." Vlad spoke up, admiring the machine.

"I wonder why we were given the big ant for a scavenging mission like this, what do they want us to actually do?" Ferd grew confused, gesturing with his hands to express himself.

"Likely they just want us to destroy another tower, should be *easy peasy* with the power we have now." Ena smirked.

"You would be right." Vlad spoke up, smoking a cigar, "We loot the remains of the tower, take as much as we can back home."

The Big Ant machine slowly descended an elevator to pick up some crew, an automatic mechanism. The squad stood still, watching as everyone filled in and went up into the main body of the giant.

"Why are we standing here? Let's go!?" Isaac was confused, nagging at Vladimir's head.

"...Nah." Vlad blew some smoke from his hollow mouth, "I'd rather drive an agile vehicle, being stuck on a giant metal tube does not sound too enticing."

"Fine." Isaac groaned and crossed his arms, "Whatever you say boss."

With a thunderous engines' roar, the Big Ant has started its activation sequence. Multiple callouts could be heard from the inside as everyone worked together to ensure a smooth ride. The squad crammed themselves into a small all-terrain vehicle, adjusting their seats and starting the engine. It was pitch-black outside, Vlad moved his goggles to see better in the dark. Right as the Big Ant was about to take its first step,

"Do *NOT* move." Vlad frantically pulled out a communication device and commanded.

There was an awkward silence for a moment, one of the machine's legs were up, hovering above the grassy floor of the night.

"Why-" 
"Who are YOU to be yelling such commands?! Let's get a move on!" A voice came from the other side, seemingly agitated.

With a mind-numbing stomp, the Big Ant started walking closer to the tower. Vlad had nothing to say, he harshly shifted gears and deviated somewhere far from the allies. The rest of the squad was busy applying goggles, all the bumps in the terrain made it slightly hard to put it on. There was a simple objective for the beginning, all they have to do is get the Big Ant onto an appropriate distance so it can hit the tower. It was also mounted with an electromagnetic pulse cannon as well, which could disable primarily Citadelarian shields temporarily. Vlad continued driving, somewhere close to the large hills far from the rest.

"Are you not even gonna tell us what you saw?" Ena was dumbfounded, even with the goggles she couldn't see a thing.

"Take my binoculars." Ferd offered, "Maybe we'll see something with these."

"Thanks honey." With a sweet voice, she held the binoculars and looked into the distance, it was pitch-black. "Bruh, these are for daytime."

"Right, sorry..." He'd carefully take back the binoculars.

The machine stomped in the distance, making its way closer and closer to the tower. Sudden rumbling emanated from afar, something was coming. Several green rhombuses shined in the mountains, and with strong tremors massive bipedal walkers rose from the ground. With distant roars, its singular eyes went online and its cannons were immediately set to be aimed. The Citadelarians would not let them simply pass.

"There are seven of those." Vlad murmured, "There is a chance the ant survives, if we and other mates in small machines take out walkers fast."

"With nothing?!" Ferd reacted, "Last time we were scrapping these things we had cannons and anti-armor or whatever!"

"Boy, be surprised. These walkers are very vulnerable. Name your ideas team." Vlad replied as he continued driving, observing the walkers taking position.

"Sir, Vlad, you think those walkers would trip over tow cables?" Ena spoke up as she took out a thick pile of cables from the trunk. 

"Like from that one awesome movi-"

"Yes." Vlad nodded.

"A precise shot with a missile to the knee!" With the tone of a maniac, Isaac grinned.

"We could climb the walker..." Ferd thought as he eyed the climbing gloves.

"Simple as." He talked, "We need communication, there is a plan."

One of the Citadelarian walkers charged up its cannon, and in a sudden flash a bright white beam flew across the night sky directly into the Ant. A bubble appeared around the ant, shielding the machine from the beam. The collision left behind a huge explosion, the Ant suffering only minimal damage.

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY at - 85%*" A masculine robotic voice announced within the machine, the crew inside were frantically loading shells, preparing to fire at one of the opposing walkers.

"Vlad here, again, do you hear me." Vlad picked up the communicated device and spoke again, "*W-1*, *W-2*, *W-3*, all of you prepare towing cables. Immobilize the walkers by tying it around their legs, over."

"Understood, copy that." Anonymous voices came back from the speaker.

All the small vehicles deviated from the Ant's position and spread out across the field, "Stick by the mountains, lesser chance of becoming a target. Use the darkness to your advantage, turn off all signals if you become a target." Vlad continued to speak.

"That knee spot only opens up when they walk, right?" Isaac asked, "That's rough timing."

Another Citadelarian walker finally charged up its cannon and fired at the Ant again, same explosion, same damage. The Ant continued to march closer towards the tower.

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY AT - 70%*" The voice could be heard from the radio transmission.

"What are you doing?! Eliminate those walkers already! We can't stand here forever!" A burly voice came from the speaker. Vlad just rolled his eyes.

"Yo, load your launcher with the hook." Ena spoke up, "Only viable thing to use around here."

"SURE, but it better not jam my whole love!" Annoyed, Isaac responded. She handed the cable over and he fit the hook of it inside the missile launcher. "God, how do you just casually handle this thing? The cable's so heavy!"

The lights of their small vehicle suddenly went out as they got close to a Citadelarian walker. Isaac readied the launcher and fired at the machine's heel. It didn't go through, the armor was simply too thick to penetrate with a hook.

"These gloves could be gr-" Ferd muttered to himself, but was interrupted swiftly by Ena's "You're coming with me!" She swiftly took out the two pairs of climbing gloves, grabbed Ferd by his scruff, and jumped out of the vehicle with him. As his worried self was being carried over by Ena, he put on a pair of gloves that she gave him. She ran fast, following the walkers' massive steps. Each stomp was devastatingly loud enough to make them easily lose focus, but not for her. She stopped when she was close enough, stretching one of her arms and pointing at the leg; in an unusual move she threw Ferd directly at it, who stuck his landing by hugging the leg. Ena smiled, she put on the gloves and leapt at the leg, slowly making her way upwards to him.

"*OKAY*, what's gotten into you?!" He worryingly yelled out as soon as she came up next to him.

"We're not letting this walker get away, are we?" She raised an eyebrow, somehow nonchalant during all this.

"But you know... your state! You should be avoiding action!" He looked down, and then at her.

As the fierce wind blew, Ena thought of something to say, but instead she firmly held his hand and smiled. That move cleansed any anxious thought from Ferd's mind, he got the signal and knew that it would all be fine. After that short moment they continued to climb together, the Citadelarian walkers continued to charge and fire at the Ant.

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY AT - 40%*" That male announcer sound again, hints of sparks could be heard in the background.

"Not even a single walker down! Do someth-"

"*PATIENCE.*" Vlad, irritated, yelled out and closed the transmission. Him and Isaac managed to drive close to another walker, he readied his beloved missile launcher to fire again, this time with actual explosives. In the meantime, other squads have managed to circle and tie the cables around the walkers, though there was an issue.

"Vlad, *W-4*, they just stop moving when they're tied! What's the big plan???" With a worried tone, a transmission was picked up.

"I mean, they have a point, that dastardly knee only opens up when they walk." Isaac looked up and thought.

While that problem was going on, at the same time the Ant finally managed to load its first explosive ordinance and fire at a walker. The shell fired and slowly flew over the battlefield with a sparkly yellow trail, the targeted walker tried to evade the shot, but due to its tied feet it couldn't and it directly took the shot. That would be one down, six left to go.

"They are built to be mobile, good job team." With a completely unamused voice, Vlad left a transmission for the others to hear.

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY AT - 25%*" This time, the voice was glitching out slightly. The leaders inside had nothing to say, only sweat came from their faces. The crew frantically continued to load more shells, firing at the immobilized walkers.

Isaac counted and calculated the precise time he'd need to fire at the knee, and with a hint of luck he took the shot. Once the missile hit, the whole center of the leg exploded and the entire walker was brought down. He maniacally laughed before the ash and smoke from the impact would start suffocating him.

"*W-4*, what is your idea for the remaining three walkers?! They are not immobilized, there are not enough squads down there to do so!" With a panicked voice, a voice came over from the transmission. Vlad had something to say, but chose not to, and instead drove over to another walker to destroy its leg.

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY AT - 10%*" Now the voice was completely bugged out. One of the walkers fell in the distance, only two remained.

One of the walkers hissed and roared. Black smoke came out of its various exhaust pipes, its green lights turned red. It was overcharging itself to take down the Ant for good. Vlad was closing in with the vehicle to take it down quickly, but they were immediately shined upon by a huge spotlight and marked as a target. The walker charged and fired in smaller but more rapid bursts, walking fast towards the Ant. 

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY AT*" And the lights inside of the Ant went out. It stopped walking and started backing away as it tanked the strikes from the opposing walker. Slowly, the most critical systems were shutting down.

"Eat this!" A familiar voice came by from an unknown signal. The overcharged walker was hit by a powerful green beam. It pierced through it in silence, the whole shell exploding a second later. The remains fell apart in front of the damaged Ant, and the last walker simply just sat down. Ena bust one of those small doors open and walked out drenched in sweat, with Ferd right behind her shocked. She stretched and yawned, like as if nothing extra had ever happened. Vlad drove up to them both and picked them up, he exhaled his pent up breath of out relief. The Ant was set back in action and continued to march ever closer to the tower. Upon reaching its destination, it would fire an electro-magnetic pulse to disable its shields, and then it would fire one of those shells to destroy the tower in a flawless single hit. They had to act fast to collect all the remains, Citadelarian reinforcements were clearly on the way.
As the Disobedient dropships flew by to pick up resources, all the allies were sat next to each other around a campfire. They celebrated Ferd and Ena, the duo that never disappoints, the duo that brings everyone good luck. She brought out a guitar and played something iconic from the top of her head, everyone brought out some food and drinks to celebrate this well-earned victory, together.

Hours later, back in their sanctuary, the Ant they had used for the mission was placed somewhere close-by. Nobody had a clue what to use it for, but everyone wanted to fix it, and perhaps turn it into a new shelter. Ferd laid in his bed, he thought a lot about what had happened today. Ena wasn't this strong, especially in her current state, oddly enough she wasn't anywhere near him during this nice cold evening. He went out as the sun set to check their cliffside, and there she was. All alone, sitting on the waving grass, playing an unfamiliar tune on her guitar flawlessly. He didn't want to interrupt her, instead he sat somewhere at the back, watching and listening. The glasses he had kept on his forehead the whole time, they slipped and fell on his snout.

He looked at her with the glasses on, and for some odd reason, it felt like as if she was invisible, unmoving, nonexistent.

I'll forever be with you in the shadows, she says.
