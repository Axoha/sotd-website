"Magnificent, ain't it?" Houston talked as they both observed the hollow and empty interior of the museum while their footsteps echoed throughout the space, "Before the opening, only a small fraction of this place was available to see, and even that was a pretty massive collection!"

"You seem to know a lot about this place..." Ferd mumbled out as he looked at the cracked paintings on the walls.

"I work here!" They spread their arms, their voice echoing, "Well, for the most part! I can tell you all about the interests 'round here."

"I'd love to know one thing." He paused, "What is this museum even for?"

"The origins of this world, and possibly the beginnings of time itself." Suddenly, their voice turned into a more mysterious tone, "Thousands of relics and ruins lie around the empty void, and whatever we manage to retrieve, we study to its core."

"Man, what a cool job." He shrug.

They laughed, "But that's not my job! I'm a measly technician here, fixing whatever problems anyone has! *It's not that cool, I hate it.*"

Both of them continued to walk. Ferd closely looked at the lost relics, most of them were made of gold plating and an unknown heavy and dense material perfect for armor. There were weapons, many weapons.

"Oh, this is one of my favorites." They sighed, "The so-called *'SPEAR'* mechs, a bipedal versatile machine that can do anything, and I mean that."

"Doesn't look that comfy inside." He held a look with wide eyes, curious.

"With what we can assume, it wasn't." They shook their head, "Those systems, an experienced soldier would be put inside and lodged with tubes to power the machine with their blood! Seems pretty secure for a password, maybe, but ain't that brutal? Inhumane?"

That reminded Ferd of a past experience in the Disobedient army.

--

*"Yo, what do they even put in these... 'Little Bugger' machines?" He tilted his head, asking a forgotten war commander.*

*"Prisoners, traitors, it's perfect! Before we get access to those automated variants, we can use fresh bodies to do all the work. Empties out prisons, these walkers are cheap n' easy to make, ain't that fun?"*

*"Even Citadelarians?"*

*"Even those!"*

--

"Hey, you there?" They wave their hand in front of his face.

"Oh, yes, I am! I was just reading all those paragraphs?" He slightly stuttered.

"You seem pretty interested in these, no wonder for a Disobedient raised dude." They smirked.

They walked further into the museum. A massive pillar stood at the center of the next room they approached, paired with glass railings and ominous lights for the most atmospheric experience. There was another floor below them, the height was great. The pillar held several paintings, and the stained glass high above them also held some strange symbols.

"Feels like a church." Ferd softly spoke, feeling under pressure of the grand architecture.

"This place is the strongest evidence we have for the 'Divine Era'." They also softly spoke, "All these paintings on the glasses and on the walls, they tell a huge story, it's a great read! Pretty sure I have it all memorized by now."

"Tell me all about it." He confidently talked, "Nothing here really makes sense."

"Well, how do I begin..."

*The age of time and space.*
*There is a common belief that there once existed a time before ours, a time much more grand than we could ever imagine, a time where Angels and Demons were real. It all begins at the absolute point of heaven, the coronation of a rogue angel to ascend into the great throne of gold. With them in charge as king, all the worlds came to suffer. All the stars decayed, all the color faded, it was clear, an end was soon to come.*
*Humanity, innocent lives build a pillar in hopes for just something to happen, something to save them from the slow death that was corroding it all. Their prayers were answered by a small messenger angel, who had descended down from the heavens. It offered unlimited resources for everyone, anything that a soul wished for, and with that the whole population managed to stand up to its legs and begin a new life. The Holy Earth was established, ruled by six directors, an utopia where angels came to coexist with us, the people. A sanctuary where they could escape from the tyranny of the new king.*
*Thousands of years later, an angel of the final generation is born. Determined to take down the king, they create the gauntlet capable of anything. Anything could be created out of thin air with just a simple gesture with the great gauntlet, anything that comes to mind, anything that you wish for, including personal abilities. Once they were ready, they flew high up into the skies to space, and they would initiate war, which would become their name in the end. Millenia of battles pass by, the gauntlet is passed from one to another, a total of six wielders of the gauntlet were known to live and lead. They were all the same variant, the same person continuing the fight to end the monochrome era.*
*It all ends with a violation of the sacred rule. The king, aware, had this in their plan all the time. He mustn't be killed by someone possessing angelic power, for he was an angel too. The known Reconstruction event happens, where existence itself would cease to exist and begin anew by the Prismatic God. The last wielder, a small child, pleads for another chance, pleads for mercy, pleads for a better life, and so their wishes were granted at a great cost.*

"Yuh, that's most of it for the start!" They smirked, "Epic, ain't it?"

"It's confusing..." He'd scratch his head, "Feels like a lot of details are missing."

"Don't wanna be here talkin' all day, y'know?" They shrugged, "All the answers lie around here."

Both of them stopped leaning against the rails and continued their walk across the museum. There were retrieved artifacts, bells, walls, scraps from the so-called 'Divine Era', an interesting sight. The sun descended down, shining directly onto the large stained glass making for a beautiful hallway.

"Oh, so late already." They thought, "I gotta show you something before it gets dark."

They hold his hand and drag him into somewhere else, right before they were about to come back to the entrance. Houston walked up to a dusty elevator and input a code, the elevator revealing itself to be a door into a hallway. Ferd was confused, unsure, but he would let himself be guided anywhere. The hallway was dark, felt like something huge was on them at all times.

"You want to know more about the grand project, don't you?" They joyfully asked.

"Project, how do you- I mean what are you talking about?" Anxious thoughts began to intrude his mind.

"Don't let go of my hand, at least for this moment." Their voice turns more serious, "That grand project, it's all over the news, I know you're here for that."

"Um..." Ferd had nothing to say, he continued to walk right behind Houston.

The lights right next to their walkway began to turn on in a sequence, illuminating the space and vanquishing the darkness. Another pillar stood right in front of them, inscribed with text and paintings as usual, but this time it held a glass chamber within - there was the gauntlet from the tale, carefully kept on a red cushion.

They smiled, "This is my favorite, secluded and hidden spot. Here lies the all powerful gauntlet, soon to be opened for the population to see." They let go of his hand.

"Woah..." Ferd was immediately stuck to the glass, "That can't be real, how is it so perfect? How is there no damage?"

"That's something they're figurin' out." They shook their head, "I don't know, I'm just a measly worker 'round here. Maybe it's a fake copy, which would be pretty funny."

Ferd revolved around the pillar, looking at the ancient texts and paintings. Inside of one was a small black bear, oddly similar to the Masy he met a while ago.

"I don't understand why you'd come all the way over here, to betray your kind for something you don't even know anythin' about." They tilted their head, "But, y'know, whatever it is, I'd wanna participate, even if it makes my big boss mad."

"You think I'm gonna steal this?" He shook his head, "Why would I do that?!"

"You didn't come over here to the Babylon for nothin', it was very brave of you to even do that." They snatched the glasses off of his forehead, "I know a piece of you yearns for a chance to find and save her."

"Okay you're being real creepy." He grabbed his glasses back, "What's the deal?!"

"What's your deal?!" They were confused, "You wanna know more???"

He paused, "...No, actually." He turned to look at the gauntlet, there was an awkward and silent moment, "This doesn't lead to anything else."

Houston only watched with big eyes, with a hint of concern.

"I don't understand why I was called to be sent here, but, if it all truly is because of that gauntlet..." He slowly spoke more to himself rather than them, "I'll take it, I'll steal it, I'll need it, there is no other way for me to find her otherwise."

They smiled, "Hell yeah, dude."

"How strong is this glass? What type?" He pointed fingers at it.

"Fragile, surprisingly." They replied, "Thick n' bulletproof looks quite ugly, not really necessary for a private spot like-"

And the glass shattered.
