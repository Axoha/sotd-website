"...The Citadel's greatest weapon to date."

Initiate an electric shock.

"...The monochrome threat is now under safe management by the Citadel, as proven by the newly revealed 'Genkatan'."

We must get this gauntlet to work, as ordered by the New Babylon.

"...The Disobedient, Resistance, any opposing force of the Citadel halted their offense. Those that attack are decimated almost instantly."

We must...

"...It does not think, it does not speak, it only reacts to commands."

"...It does not cost to deploy, the 'Genkatan' can simply appear in any place anywhere in the known universe."

Initiate another electric shock.

Somewhere at the edge of the universe, an old jukebox played classic songs at the heart of the Citadel's greatest facility. Tartarus, the most grand prison directed by the Citadel, containing any and all entities that were once considered a threat to the nation. It is a space station developed for millennia, built upside down with the gravity inversed. Layers of mazes, thousands of floors, millions of the greatest dangers rot here for their whole lives. Kept disturbingly clean and shiny, maintained by thousands of Citadelarian retainers each day.

Inside one of the main seven cafeterias, "Outta my way, chum. This sludge is MINE!" Ally with no mercy knocks a bulky prisoner onto the cold steel ground.

"You should stop that..." Houston nervously chuckles, "I know we've been here a while but..."

"What? Get in the damn line nerd, always seize the spot while there's space!" She grabs their black jumpsuit and drags them to her. 

"I guess." They rolled their eyes.

"Let's see what they're serving... White sludge with green little things on it, black sludge that looks like depression itself, orange sludge that is totally carrots (hell no!)... Yeah the menu hasn't changed since yesterday good luck making good food today." She scratched her chin as she observed.

"Green things? You mean parsley?" They tilted their head.

"Yeah! I love those!" She smiled, turning her head back to the front, "We'll be taking those two again."

"Is there bread by chance." They tapped her shoulder and she swiftly turned back to their face again.

"Um..." She stood on her toes, "I... don't see anything- NEVERMIND!"

"Bread is finally on the menu?!" Houston was flabbergasted.

Meanwhile in the deeper levels, cell number ninety-nine. Ferd was tossed into an empty steel room of no recognition. Voices spoke to him in a language that he did not understand, his gauntlet shined with a blinding light. Suddenly, he was surrounded by retainer holograms. The task became clear now, survive.

"...And there it is." Houston finished the sandwich. The bread was stiff and hard, the gloop within ugly, its the most they could do.

"Man, Houst, maybe its not worth it." She shook her head chewing on the strange pasta, "Good luck trying to even get a bite out of the bread!"

Wave after wave, Ferd brawled his way through the endless horde. Using what was given, punching, stabbing, shooting, endless trial one after another. He'd be impaled, torn apart, shot, but the cursed gauntlet would regenerate him back to a healthy state. The Citadelarians watched with a close eye, their computers jotting down every single move he made, and what occurred within his body. The gauntlet must begin working according to Babylon's order.

"We're never getting that bread again." Ally looked at Houston with jaded eyes.

"Mhat?" Houston talked through their annoyingly loud crunching. They made a variety of expressions while eating, trying their best to enjoy the sandwich.

Without words she reached her hand out to snag the brick sandwich out of their grasp to throw it somewhere far out in the cafeteria, "You wanted to talk about your escape plan."

An audible "OW" sound throughout the space.

"Girl." They were annoyed, "Okay, about that, I don't know!"

"What do you mean you don't know?!" She gestured, confused.

"I was fully expecting Ferd to realize the gauntlet by now, but its been weeks, nothing! That man wields a tool made for gods and nothing is going on!" They were getting louder, "This facility shuffles itself each hour, if we step outside the gravity inversion will stop and we'll plummet to outer space, and even if we do find a way out SOMEHOW, the Genkatan will appear and quite literally delete us!" They counted fingers, keeping track of all the ways noted.

"You're saying its hopeless." She raised an eyebrow.

"Well, duh!" They snapped, "This is the most secured spot in the whole universe!"

Often times Ferd would collapse on the floor, unmoving. Each time he'd fall into the comatose state he'd be struck by a powerful shock that would forcibly wake his body, in case of any organ failure, such occurrences would be fixed immediately by the Citadelarians various technologic arms of medical equipment. He shook, its as if his mind melted. He screamed for help, for his loved ones, but no one came. The Citadelarians used many psychological methods as well, mimicking the tender voice of Ena through a speaker. Whatever, anything, it just had to work, but it never did.

"Houston, I don't want to be a local prison bully for the rest of my life." She looked directly at his eyes, "I am not gonna wait for Ferd to magically show up again. I wanna break free from my shackles and free us all."

"Everyone here wants to! I ain't understand, you think you're the only one?!" They weren't too happy about this conversation.

"Only one willing to." She said through gritted teeth, "I am done with this place."

Meanwhile, at a different main cafeteria, Vlad and Isaac played a game of chess with food as most of what remained from the camp watched. Isaac would lose every time, but constantly asked to play again. Once he played enough games, he'd get so angry that he would end up eating the whole chess board.
At a deeply secured office somewhere within Tartarus, Bill would be sat listening to some of his favorite classical pieces. He wanted answers, but was always put on hold. He was starting to grow a little concerned about how little information he had about the gauntlet and the whole planned prophecy as a whole, all he knew that if it were not followed...

"Boss, you requested information, correct?" Rose opened the door with a joyful greet, "I got loads, that should quench the thirst."

"About time." He rolled his eyes, rocking on the chair, "Spill it all."

"There is *GREAT* progress on the gauntlet, as received by fellow informants. I managed to get my first ever working creation back, which used the unstable matter formula of course, Juno. All the prisoners are still in place..." He went on to mumble.

"Tell me about the prophecy." He asked, straightforward.

"Oh, that. Not ready! I cannot fulfill that request boss!" He nervously jittered, "But I can say we are gonna reach the end ASAP! The threat will be over, lest we get that damn gauntlet to work!"

"Nothing new." Bill sighed, "Nothing new..."

Once the hours of agonizing trials were over, Ferd would be let to rest in a comatose state. No time to think. No time to see. No time to believe... But there was time to dream. He'd dream of nice things, the last touch of Ena's hand, frolicking in the flowery white plain fields with Houston and Ally, making a gadget out of something on the first try. He'd dream that he would grow a pair of dazzling red wings, soaring through the cosmos, being cheerful and happy, full of love. He would reach out to the sky, getting ahold of something beautiful, which would sprout into joy. It was childish, pathetic, but he couldn't be blamed. As his unconscious body laid on the steel, he'd dream.

"Ally." Houston grabbed her arm, "Don't do this, just don't!"

"Who knows what could be happening to him!" She forcibly slipped her arm from their grasp, "I am going to find Ferd. I can't just stand around and wonder anymore, and if you don't like that, stay behind and rot."

Houston couldn't stand around anymore either. With a great gulp, they ended up nodding and changing their mind.

The most absurd, reckless, and most certainly death awaiting prison breakout was bound to begin.
