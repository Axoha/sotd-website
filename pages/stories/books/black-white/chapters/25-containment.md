The deepest cell, cut off from the rest of the universe. Barricaded by dozens of steel doors of maximum security, riddled with sensors that see even the slightest movement. Ferd groaned as he got back on his feet, his consciousness finally coming back. His legs trembled, not out of fear. The grand entrance loomed at his face, defined by a large steel gate through which anything could fit. It was cold, he fell back on all fours clinging to his chest.

Rose froze, staring blankly at the live camera footage. He immediately dialed his boss, claiming that he must come immediately. Something grand was coming, something not even they knew, he pulled out a notebook and began furiously jotting down notes again. 

"Doc, do we summon the Genkatan over?" A Citadelarian raised their hand and asked.

"No!" He snapped, "No! No! No! Do not disrupt anything, be quiet!"

The camera footage suddenly turned to static, one channel after another. The gates began opening without any authorized permissions, all the securities shut down by themselves.

"Could it be...?" He muttered.

"Yo." Bill opened the door, "Doc, what am I missing-"

"Send all the people, all the equipment, down to the deepest cell right NOW!" He frantically scratched his head.

"What's the deal?-"

Rose got his hands on Bill's shoulders, "You know all that study regarding the contained thing, right??? It is inviting the gauntlet, we do not know why! Please send out the order!"

Ally and Houston kept running from the Genkatan... until it just stopped. Receiving a new task, it tracked back with unintentionally strong steps into the darkest shadows and disappeared. Ally was confused but relieved, they have been just running out of breath for a long while now. Took a short break, then walked into the elevator chamber which was finally nearby. Before they could select a floor, the lights dimmed and alarms blared.

"That's for us, isn't it?" Ally was concerned, looking around.

"Oh..." Houston held their head, "Oh... no no no no!"

"Uh? What's the deal? *I know it's not great to trigger an alarm but...*" Her mind slid into trance, she input a random floor inside the elevator and it slowly started descending.

"No, listen to me!" They grabbed her shoulders and turned her over to their face, "Good news, this isn't for us! Bad news, this is an alarm designed for a breach in the lowest level of Tartarus!"

She scratched her head, "What the hell does any of that mean?"

"If whatever that was contained in the chamber gets out..." They rubbed their face, "...I don't know!"

The elevator stopped with a friendly sounding ringtone while the muffled alarms blared in the distance. The doors opened, and everyone from the main Babylon crew were stood at the front of the elevator gates. Houston and Ally both slowly turned their heads to the sight of Bill and co looking at them with a wide variety of faces.

The gates slowly opened before Ferd, he couldn't help but stare in confusion. A distant voice called to him, and he followed what was said. From the ceiling of the great hallway dozens of meters up, the Genkatan stuck with the unlit areas of the room staring down with its six eyes.

A text slowly wrote itself,
*Proceed, do not be afraid.*

It was tense. Ferd's gauntlet stopped shining, stuttering his walk as the gates continued to open. Technological whirrs, rotating gizmos, the loud clanking of the barricades, an overwhelming sense continued.

A final text slowly wrote itself,
*Come forth, creation.*

The final gate opened into the abyss. Dim lights flickered on in an orchestrated sequence, from the behind to the front. The chamber itself was round, and at the middle stood a giant floating orb. The gates slammed shut right behind Ferd, and a singular glowing white dot appeared at the orb's silhouette. Six reflective rhombi manifested themselves around the orb, and an eerie ambiance filled the background. With a distorted holy scream, the lights in the chamber intensified to the point of some shattering. The crystal rhombi shift into spikes, and without any warning they struck at Ferd piercing through the ground. By miracle he evaded the sudden offense, he was fighting against such aggression during his time in Tartarus constantly. Catching up to his breath, he began to sprint, revolving around the orb. The dotted eye would follow him no matter where he went, the relentless strikes one after another continued from the rhombi. Unrecognizable and illogical light would form itself in a straight line, charging with a hum before exploding into an unpassable blinding beam that would most certainly evaporate anything that it crossed. He would not let it, constantly dodging and dashing to not even get grazed. Once a rhombi struck the ground he swung his gauntlet at it with full force, shattering it with just a single punch. A deafening holy scream came from the orb once more, its attacks growing relentless and faster. More beams of light would appear and blow, more rhombi would be manifested and used. Ferd would focus on his breath, destroying each and every spike that struck the floor besides him. Two down, three down, five down, the orb grew manic with its attacks, manifesting up to thirty rhombi to finally execute Ferd with. There would be no escaping such amount, the light grew with fury. Ferd set his body to a stance, conscious enough to take it down even despite the odds. Once the first spike was flung, it lost all its momentum and shattered on the steel ground, followed by the rest. The orb shook, and its next holy scream was cut off. The light in its eye faded, and suddenly it wrapped itself in black chain. Ferd, confused, walked up to the orb with his heart beating tremendously fast. As he leaned his face closer to the chain, a shining golden arm pierced the outer shell of the orb directly from the inside. Whatever was contained inside seeped into existence, forming cracks in every visible and finally shattering it all into an empty void.

**ACT 0000000 CHAPTER 0000000 - FACE**

*"I want to do something myself for once, I want to do good."*
*"All this time he had been using everyone else for his goal, he is incapable without anyone to force - he has nothing on a person like me."*

In a pitch, dark, hopeless, little dimension, Ferd found himself awake on the floor soon after that. Nothing could be seen, only slight murmurs of sentences spoken long ago. Ferd's gauntlet flickered until it fixed itself, managing to bring light into the void. The floor was of concrete, riddled with black chains everywhere, hanging from the ceiling, the walls. A single yellow light permeated through the void.

A text-
A text was struck and shattered before anything could be written

The single yellow light disappeared, Ferd's gauntlet stopped working, it was all dark again.

Ferd sat down, rubbed his eyes, and suddenly appeared in a city. Nighttime, snowing, festive. The populations walked around him, talking to each other in friendly manner completely ignoring Ferd at the middle of the active crosswalk. He got up and looked around, he was at the heart of New York city during December, 2006. He walked around, checking the snow, looking at the stores, before walking head first into someone's chest and slipping on the snow by pure accident.

"Um, sir, are you okay?"

The voice came from above. Ferd was tired, he groaned and rubbed his eyes as he looked up at the face of the heavily clothed individual. They reached out their right hand to help him get up.

"Thanks... I suppose." He struggled to stand, the stranger helped him stabilize. Whoever that was, they were giant. A black furred cat with slight white marks, small eyes and the friendliest smile one could imagine.

"What's your name? Need anything? Water? Food?" They begun walking together, the stranger helped them.

"My name is Ferd. I'm good, thank you." He looked down saying that.

"That's pretty funny..." They scratched their chin, "I'm Ferdinand, nice to meet you!"

Ferdinand reached out their left charred golden arm for a handshake. For Ferd, a bizarre sight, but he went in for the gesture with his gauntlet. The sudden contact shattered everything and all went black again.

**ACT 0000001 CHAPTER 0000001 - ZENITH**

In a pitch, dark, hopeless, little dimension, Ferd found himself awake on the floor soon after that. Nothing could be seen, only no murmurs of sentences spoken long ago. Ferd's gauntlet flickered until it fixed itself, managing to bring light into the void. The floor was of concrete, riddled with black chains everywhere, hanging from the ceiling, the walls. A single yellow light permeated through the void.
Ferd proceeded to walk forward into the yellow light. All the chains have been leading to the light. The individual, Ferdinand, was bound by it all in the air - static, unmoving. The chains obscured his eye, his nose, his neck, his chest, his everything, but the golden left arm was wrapped the most. The atmosphere was dense, Ferd decided to tear the chains apart with his gauntlet. Each strike descended him lower, let him loose, until eventually he was free from the grasp of the chains. He'd land on his feet and a fist on the ground, standing up to face the light above. Like a thousand suns, his golden arm was set ablaze. With a hollow expression he approached Ferd and began throwing punches, swinging with a force that a single strike could erase whatever unfortunate enough to cross its path. He was slow, but Ferd was still only narrowly evading all the punches. The yellow light in the void grew more intense, nothing but jagged breaths sound through the room. Ferd refused to fight back, even if it were to do nothing. Ferdinand raised his arm into the sky and manifested anything into this sad void to take down Ferd. Holy glowing objects, followed by an explosive beam right from the golden arm. His movements grew slower and slower, until he just stood at the middle of the spotlight. With a guttural yell he began to bash his golden left arm against the floor, causing it to shine brighter. He clawed at it, tearing off the wire, the plates, it stung but he continued. He wasn't attacking Ferd anymore, he was attacking himself. Ferd took the risk and approached him, getting ahold of the golden arm with his gauntlet in a swift move and tearing it off with a forceful pull. The arm, bent, crushed, began seeping black fluids from its interior. Cracks of glass began showing in existence again, only a matter of time before everything would go void. Ferdinand bled black from his mouth and nose, all the bleeding from his left arm soaked the floor, invisible in the void. Ferd pulled the golden arm again, finally managing to tear it off Ferdinand. The cracks in existence grew too fast, the golden arm spurt out and generated more of its blood. Ferdinand tipped over and his body fell as Ferd took the hand of the golden arm and crushed it with the gauntlet. The glass shattered, all went void.

**ACT 999999997 CHAPTER 999999997 - DENOUEMENT**

"That's pretty funny..." They scratched their chin, "I'm Ferdinand, nice to meet you!"

Ferdinand reached out their left hand for a simple handshake. For Ferd, a friendly sight, he went in for the gesture with his gauntlet.

"Could your issue revolve maybe around that?" Ferdinand pointed at his gauntlet, "You don't need to tell me all about it, I get it."

All went white as the forces of the Citadel finally penetrated the final gate of the chamber.

**ACT III CHAPTER III - CONTAINMENT**

No one could believe the sight. The Babylon's recorded history, the age of time and space. The supposed angel of the final generation laid on the steel floor with a charred, destroyed golden left arm together with Ferd. A simple loud heartbeat echoed through the chamber, the forces immediately rushed into action to examine and take care. Ally forcibly broke free from her restraints, destroying Houston's cuffs as well as she rushed to Ferd.
They both woke up, Ferd and Ferdinand. Ferd woke up to Ally holding his head and tears streamed from his eyes. His mind was mentally breaking down, he thought he'd never see her again. Houston only glanced over at Ferd before rushing over to Ferdinand, the great titan from a time long gone. The Babylon and the Citadelarians did not care for Ally and Houston, something that changes the course of everything was just uncovered.
