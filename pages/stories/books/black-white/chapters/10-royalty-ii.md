The silhouette extended its arms at its front, and out of thin air two sharp black chakrams were made. It grabbed them both and slashed them to its back, intimidating the duo below it with its fierce power.

"That's her." She gasped, "That's her! Emma, hear me, please!" She plead with a voice sweetened by desperation.

The unstable creature that hovered above them hung its arms freely, it stared, and burst out laughing. Its laugher echoed through the caverns, bringing the attention of multiple blinking lights within the fog. Ferd glanced over to Ally, right before grabbing her arm and running away.

"*VII XX*." The duo heard something, "*I VI D.*"

"What are you doing?! Let me sort this this out!!!" She was trying to get out of his grip.

And that was when one of the chakrams was thrown at a high velocity, stabbing and cracking the ground right besides them. It oozed off black ink, and soon everything around them was obscured by darkness. Ferd's gauntlet shined with power, its light repelling the unnatural darkness. Ally quickly took back her words, she leapt onto Ferd's back refused to set foot. He continued to run in an unclear direction, having his right arm stretched out in front of him covering his way with the gauntlet. An ominous breathing noise was heard everywhere, and it felt like the world quadrupled and spun in their eyes. Ferd managed to find a way out of the darkness, falling onto the floor and breathing heavily as Ally finally got off his back. He was shaking, and so was she.

"*IX X VIII.*" The voice came back, speaking in numbers.

"Whatever you are, stop this, please..." He was tired and dizzy, feeling sick, speaking to whatever spoke to him.

The silhouette appeared again, holding its two chakrams steady. It's dotted eyes and mouth morphed into a heart, then an eye, then heartbreak, then shattered pieces, then numbers, then a smile. He didn't understand any of that, and it likely didn't mean anything. He was about to say something, but before he could, the silhouette threw its two chakrams with a striking force at each side of the floor they were standing on. It was stained glass, they were standing right at the center. It cracked and shattered below them and they fell into a deeper abyss.

They fell directly through more glass.

**ꖡꖾꗍ ꕗ           ꖾ ꗞꘘ ꖡꖾꗍ ꕷ         ꕒ ꖀ         ꕒ**

Each layer of glass hurt more, it was completely mute.

**ꖡꖾꗍ ꗣꖦꕯꗱꖾꖡ          ꖡꖾꗍ         , ⱲꕯꝆꝆ ꕗꗞꖡꖾ ꘘꗇꝆꝆ ꕒꕯ          Ꝇꔇ ꖡꖾ𐝥ꗞꖹꗱꖾ ꖡꖾꕯꕷ ꗱꝆꗇꕷꕷ         ꖡꖾꕯꕷ ꕮꗞꕮꗍꖦꖡ**

And so they did.

The impact into the ground was unforgiving.

Both of them couldn't move, after some time Ferd mustered some strength to lift himself up with his arms. He looked over to Ally and himself, both of them were terribly bruised, and his gauntlet kept on glowing. An unknown light cast a beautiful ray through stained glass which shined directly at them both.

"Ferd..." She spoke, "I can't move."

He was alarmed immediately, he slowly crawled over to her, "What do you mean?!"

She coughed blood, "Well... we just fell... an entire skyscraper height... Urrrghhhh... I... always... wondered what would happen... if I fell from my walker..." And she laid there, weirdly satisfied.

"No, no, you are not bleeding out in front of me. You get that?!" He fumbled his hands, using his one oversized scarf to put pressure on her bleeding.

But she grabbed his arm, signaling him to stop. "Don't, it's okay... This place is beautiful." She smiled, "The stained glass... the paintings..."

He ignored that she grabbed her arm, he proceeded, but then she grabbed it again with a stronger grip. "Why are you doing this?" He asked.

"Axolotls, regenerate, dummy." She looked at him in the eyes, "At least, that's what I always believed." And she laughed.

He had nothing to say, he was worried sick, even though he had just met her today.

"You should... find her, your Ena!" She smirked, "Before... you eventually get owned... by my girlfriend... haha!" She laughed more.

"You need to promise me you'll be okay." He said with a serious tone.

"Of course... I promise." She held his hand with a firm grip, "You should go... seriously... we stand no chance against her."

Ferd held her hand and replied with a determined nod. He stood up, and hardly walked away filled with guilt. Ally wondered how he just healed his injury so fast, but then she looked at the shining gauntlet, and all of her questions were quickly answered without asking.
He walked. and walked, past graves and tombstones. The ambient light was cold and blue, the ground turned into snow. It was uncomfortably cold. He followed a path made of rubble and black ice, reflecting the unknown source of light that shined. A ruined cathedral stood in front of him, with a magical white outline that defined its shape in the void. He walked closer, and as he proceeded he began to see small black bears with long white glowing hair walking inside holding white flowers in their hands close to their chests. Those which saw Ferd backed away in fear, the gauntlet's light was feared.

"Hey, Ferd." He heard a familiar voice behind him, he swiftly turned and saw one of them talk to him in an oddly normal way. "It's me, Masy, I figured you'd need some guidance." Her voice was serious and full of grief in a way.

"I'm so confused..." He looked around, "What is going on? Why am I even here?"

"Hold my hand, with your gauntlet." She insisted, "I'll tell you everything."

He was a bit suspicious, but he gave in anyway. Upon touch the gauntlet lost all color and stopped shining, it was forcefully disabled by her force. All the other bears around them stopped worrying, and continued to proceed into the ruined cathedral for something important. Masy led him all the way inside, where footsteps echoed and even the slightest noise could be heard by anyone. They  sat on a wooden pew, inside of a spacious and massive interior filled with paintings and stained glass of the bears. There were no colors, all was only grayscale.

"Ferd." She spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, "You lost something, let's start with that."

She handed him his pair of round sunglasses, they weren't cracked and damaged anymore. "Oh, thank you so much."

"Put them on, I took some of my time fixing them, you'll need it." She continued, "Those lens are made of a special glass only found here and places such as these, interesting that you had them before."

And he listened, he put them on and... not exactly much has changed, he could just read the symbols again.

"We're the working cells of deep space. Inkas." She started talking, "For millennia referred to as 'demons', 'servants', and other, all of those which are wrong. Deep space is the background of all that exists, invisible to the normal eye. Everything is carefully woven out of strings by the creators, the angels, and all that grows old is destroyed by the demons, maintaining a balance necessary for life to grow."

A small black bear, a so-called 'Inka', walked up to the podium of the interior and stood. It was facing the other direction looking upwards, and suddenly from the stained glass appeared a giant variant of Inka. It tied its long white hair back to not obscure half the stage, and leaned towards the smaller Inka with closed eyes. It opened up its chest, revealing the beating core and its vital organs. The small Inka giggled and smiled, excitedly creating a seat at the front of the organs to start playing songs.

"Inkas are neither an angel or a demon." She continued as she listened to the beautiful melody, "We were created to fix anything wrong that comes to be, the little problems within the strings which cannot be fixed by neither of the two grand species. That's what we were destined to do, yet we wonder, why we were made to be so human?"

The small Inka played on the organ flawlessly, the giantess remained still with closed eyes, enjoying the melody.

"In the grand cosmos of timelines, on every earth exists a mortal with an Inkas' blood. Once they die, another is born. Thousands of years ago it used to be an Angel's work to lurk from the shadows and ensure the stability of life, but that was soon to be replaced by us, and its a job every Inka desires, to live a life."

"...is my Ena an Inka?" He looked to her.

"Not exactly." She shook her head, "She is something more grand, I cannot say much on that topic as I do not know. That is why I was getting so obnoxiously excited watching you play by the prophecy, because, we'll finally learn and see something spectacular!"

"...she's didn't become a monster, did she?" Ferd asked with a tinge of worry.

"That's rude." She looked at him with a frown, "If the guardian you encountered before gave you that impression, I'm sorry, she is just a maniac. All Inkas are well aware of what they are doing, no one is a monster, no one is a beast."

"Why'd *she* want to kill us?" He grew slightly confused.

"It's just a guardian's job, ensuring no mortal steps foot in places like these. I don't like it, but it is required by a new testament; if a child of any timeline comes to merge with an entity from the afterlife, a terrible sequence of events may occur. You don't need to worry, as long as I am with you, I'll hide you from the eyes of any deity that may be watching." She raised his disabled gauntlet that she was holding.

"The... afterlife?" He was concerned.

"You aren't dead." She stated, "The gauntlet brought you here, again I don't know why, we'll see? This entire place could be referred to as the unbound, hell, whatever term mortals use?" She awkwardly looked back at the stage, the Inka was having the time of its life playing on the organ.

Suddenly, the black silhouette, the guardian walked at the middle of the interior amidst the pews. Each step made a menacing metal noise, all the Inkas around watched with amusement. The small Inka that was playing the organ stopped its performance and removed the stool, while the giant Inka dissipated into the shadows. Ferd was nervous, slightly shaking as she walked right by them. The guardian set foot on stage, and at a lectern her faced morphed into a more peaceful feature. With her wobbly mouth, she spoke in an unknown language.

"What exactly is going on here?" He whispered, slowly looking at Masy who was paying full attention.

"I wanted to say, this is the ceremony of the first month, and the remembrance to all the fallen Inkas who refused to continue anymore." She softly spoke, "Ceremony of the first month, as in, the beginning of the prophecy, and the queen."

As the guardian slowly spoke as if she was citing names, her eyes slowly drifted and locked towards the pew where Masy and Ferd were sat. She spoke slower, and slower, until she stopped completely. She summoned a chakram to hold with her left hand, and in the blink of an eye she dashed and pinned Ferd against the floor. There were whispers and murmurs among the Inkas, and his gauntlet began to glow again. Masy ran to the background away from the conflict, seemingly too scared to do anything about it.

"*IX IX VII V* ?!" Her eyes disappeared and her mouth turned into a jagged one.

Ferd took deep breaths, trying to calm his nerve, his gauntlet shined for a reason. With a dirty punch, he managed to hit her directly into the face with the gauntlet, leaving white marks that bled behind. With her stunned he used the opportunity to run again as she regained her sense and chased after him with an aggressive yell. He had absolutely no clue how to use the gauntlet, but it seemed to work very well against the guardian. She summoned and threw a chakram right besides him again to surround him with darkness, but he managed to retrieve it with his gauntlet and hold onto it. A single touch with a bare hand hurt really bad, there was no choice but to fight with a single hand. She dashed again and swung with her chakram, which Ferd managed to perfectly block out with her own other chakram. She kicked the chakram out of his gauntlet and unnaturally stretched her arm to retrieve it. She threw them at him, and they would always bounce back into her hand after being blocked by the gauntlet. She was getting fed up, and eventually, she just stopped and threw the chakrams into the snow in frustration. The guardian vanished with the dark, and he laid on the ground breathing heavily.

"Hey, you're still alive." He heard something walk to him, "I was worried, you know?" Masy held a flower in her hands.

"Ugh..." He rubbed his face with his left bare hand.

"That gauntlet must be draining you..." She tilted her head, "Here, hold my hand."

And so he did, again.

"She must've recognized you are not mortal, weirdly enough, or she has just grown tired." She shrug, "Who knows, the ceremony was cut short anyway, the queen didn't show up."

"The queen..?" He was exhausted.

"Well, we have a queen. I never saw her, yet I always bring food to her room." She shrug more, "I want to guide you there, who knows, maybe she'll have something to say about you. Sorry, I wanted to talk about this before the guardian tackled you!" She giggled.

He complied, and so they went back into the ruined cathedral which was now empty. Ferd was always looking back wherever they walked, thinking of Ally, he even asked, but got an answer that led to nowhere. After climbing through tons of stairs and walking through hallways, they finally reached the giant door to the Queen's room. 

"Um..." Masy shook, "I don't wanna go there."

"Huh? But you seemed fine?" He questioned her behavior.

"I have a bad feeling, I don't want to go there." She quickly shook her head, "Take this, stick this piece of me to your gauntlet and go in. I'm out." She grabbed a piece of her shoulder and stuck it to the palm of his gauntlet, rendering it disabled even if she wasn't around. She backed away, "Ferd, please stay safe."

And she swiftly walked away.
He looked at her with concern, but then turned his head towards the door with the goal in mind. He thought maybe the queen would help her find Ena. He was determined, even if he was exhausted.

He gently opened the door. The walls were torn down, the floor was a mess, the whole room was in ruin. What once looked to be the average queen's bedroom looked ravaged and decimated by a creature. Tally marks were noted on the walls, the furniture was unusable, everything was damaged. Most importantly, the queen was sat on the bed, looking right outside of the window. A shining star lit the abyss that they were in, and the soft noise of sobbing could be heard from the queen. He was shocked at the sight, feeling unsafe, but he proceeded to go on.

"Um, ma'am?-" Immediately after saying something, his mind rang and his vision went blurry. 

The queen, slowly turned to Ferd and crawled out of the bed. She was just a black silhouette, until she got closer, when she grabbed his shoulders and stared him dead in the eyes. Her eyes darted from his face to his gauntlet, backing away in shock.

With scarily long gray hair, and a single eye of despair open, it was her, the one and only Ena. She looked unstable, rotten, twice as large, her long hair obscure most of her figure. She grabbed his shoulders with a painful firm grip.

"**ACT I - CHAPTER IX**" She yelled out, darting her eyes back and forth again from his face and the gauntlet.

He was shook, terrified, he didn't understand what was going on, he didn't know what to say.

Tears begin to flow from her eye, "**ACT I - CHAPTER X**"
 
"**ACT I - CHAPTER X**"

"**ACT I - "

The guardian reappeared again behind Ferd to protect the queen while he was vulnerable. Ena held her face, she shoved Ferd straight into the side with a great force and leapt at the guardian as she was creating her chakrams. With a gut-wrenching scream, she got ahold of the guardian and tore her body to pieces. She in response pierced her body with one of her chakrams, kicking her back to regain her stand. She yelled back, and she screamed, it was chaos, they brawled in the hallways breaking everything in their way. The walls, the floors, they crumbled and cracked with each strike. The guardian grew wings, similar to a bat to brace for what's coming. Ena, or whatever that was, melted and whimpered as she continued to morph her body into what would be the best option for the brawl. The Queen got ahold of the guardians arm and slammed her directly into the floor, breaking into the lower levels of the cathedral.
Ferd had no idea what to do, he covered his head as the screams and yells of the two deities echoed throughout the space. He could not believe any of this was happening. Masy came back, running with stubby legs, without a word she offered her hand.
The Queen's body progressively grew larger and turned black, becoming yet another silhouette among the many Inkas. It's gotten to a point where the guardian began to retreat, but couldn't, and was constantly dragged back and tormented. Neither of them could die, their regenerative capabilities were just too great. The darkness wasn't as great due to the constant flickering lights of the brawl, Masy led Ferd into the exit, both of them running through the thick snow.

"Ah, uh-huh." Ally muttered to herself, "He didn't really need to tend to my wounds, seriously, now I'm just incapacitated on the floor like a fool." She twisted her gills, "I wish he would just, let me bleed out, so I can finally be over... with..." Her speech slowed as she took in the sight of Ferd running with Masy directly towards her. Ferd picked her up and wrapped her around himself to be on his back again. Masy drew symbols on the floor, speaking in an otherworldly unknown whisper to cast a way to the surface level of the abyss. The yells of the deities came closer, and eventually both the queen and the guardian smashed through the walls of the room. They clawed and bit each other, it was unsightly, gory. Masy finished her cast in a rush, and in the next second they both vanished into the upper layer.
The stairs awaited them, and they rushed the climb through the darkness. Ferd tripped over multiple times, but he persisted. He shuffled through Ally's bag and found one of the gadgets he took from his sanctuary. 

They finally reach the top after an egregious climb. Masy closes the gate and Ferd becomes the lead, his sprinting through the snow slowly turns slower, eventually to the point he just throws himself forward through the harsh winds. He falls on his fours, yet he continues to crawl. Ally's weight on his bag, paired with the bag, the gauntlet, its all unbearable, but he's desperate for safety. Masy noticed the struggle and tried to help by dragging him, but she was too small. The ground beneath them rumbled, and from the snow not far erupted the queen. She yelled in what seemed to be excruciating pain, the guardian was nowhere to be seen. Ferd succumbed to the pressure and just closed his eyes, stopping his movement. Ally was still on his back, laying and looking around. The queen crawled over to the duo, and Masy, who watched in terror within her eyes.

It was silent, the wind blew with a lesser force.

"Get me food." Said the queen, with a hoarse voice.
