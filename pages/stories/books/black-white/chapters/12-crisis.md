"...Good evening, I'll be your host, Marie Stephanson. The shocking and rapid development over the past week has come to a close as the individual rogue soldier 'Ferd Ray' has been detained by a Disobedient scrap group he's belonged to for the past seven years. His actions have singlehandedly destroyed the Disobedient's reputation among everyone. The New Babylon is willing to assist anyone to bring over 'Ferd Ray', dead or alive, for a reward that scales way higher than one could imagine. All the great allies the Disobedient had up until this point have cut connection, Dawn of the Green Light's bought machinery and armory exploded on its own hours after the relation was terminated. The rogue 'Ferd Ray' will be attending court, and will be judged by the great leader of our name at the capital's heart tomorrow..."

A radio hardly played the broadcast amidst the ruins of a burning city. The shadows grew, the night sky was shrouded in smoke and illuminated deep red by the fires. The queen, twice the size as before, marched through the streets, dragging her oversized right arm along the cracked asphalt.

"...there have been multiple reports of fallen Disobedient planets. Unclear whether an attack by the New Babylon or something else. Last chilling transmissions from the capitals of those planets have been completely unintelligible, unclear, all the power always goes down before the fall. Concerns and the demands for answers have surged dramatically, the people, and I, are worried for the future of our well-being..."

A stark silhouette of a massive Disobedient jet model appears within the smoke in the sky.

"Target confirmed and locked, launching the warhead." A dead and serious voice sounds from a transmission.

The higher command nervously watched through rough live recordings and transmissions in a dark spacious room. It was silent, a close rich planet that held the name 'Merlina' has fallen, but this time an opportunity had finally come to strike back at the very force that terrorized the universe. The warhead was the peak of Disobedient weaponry, a single use could render an entire planet uninhabitable for decades, kept a secret from everyone but the higher command. There was no way the warhead wouldn't work, the command was focused, mourning the millions that had died. Just as the bomb was about to hit its target, the queen grabbed it by the front, squeezing the metal with a crunch as the warhead had successfully detonated.

It was eerily silent, the flash of the explosion could be seen from space.

The higher command monitored from Merlina's space station, a single tear of sweat slid through their faces. No motion signals were picked up, yet, the higher command didn't react.

But the queen, it moved. Her back was split in half, she was tearing itself apart, crying in utter and painful agony. She grew larger once again, at the center of the abnormally massive radiated crater. Her body changed as the strings and tendrils healed her gaping wounds, she evolved, and will continue to evolve.

A day has passed at the sanctuary, no missions were assigned, no news. Ferd woke up at his usual four in the morning, he strutted down into a bathroom and looked at himself through a mirror. He was a tired mess, his face feeling heavy from the weight of thoughts. He turned on the tap to wash his face, but he let the water run. He did nothing but continue to stare at himself as all of his actions began to weight on his mind. He turned his vision to his gauntlet, and gently turned off the tap without washing his face. Outside, he threw and kicked at a trash can. Lashing out in complete silence, he stomped and destroyed the garbage. His mind went numb, he hated this moment, he hated the past week, he hated it all.
As it turned to five in the morning, he exhaustingly sat on a chair at the front of his designated home. He reached out to his pocket to find his box of cigarettes, fumbling his hands as the gauntlet was way oversized.

"Hey, good morning, I suppose." Ally came around.

Ferd didn't say a word, pretending she wasn't even there.

"Don't be such a wet puppy!" She chuckled.

Ferd still didn't say anything. Ally stopped bothering with the silly personality, she sat next to him in a more serious mood.

"Are you okay?" She asked with concern.

He finally looked to his side, at Ally. There was a clear frown behind the glasses he was wearing. "No, not at all."

"Here, let me get this for you." She held his pack of cigarettes. He'd hesitantly pick one as she also took one. Once they were in their mouths, she'd nab her own lighter and light the cigarettes.

Ferd slightly blushed, he was thankful.

"You don't even need to say anything." She smiled, "I remember feeling like that on the first day, when I caught up to my girl at the desolate wastelands and she was just... gone." She gently blew some tobacco smoke from her mouth.

"I've been wanting to ask..." Ferd finally spoke up, albeit with a weak tone, "How did you get over her so *quickly?*"

Ally was mildly surprised, "I wouldn't really say I got 'over it'." She looked to the side, "It's complicated..."

Ferd didn't say anything, his eyes were widened with curiosity.

"You know, Emma, she wasn't really the best person to put it straight." She sighed, "She took my 'positive attitude' thing to another level. Never taking anything seriously, unless something bad happened to her of course. She'd like, criticize me, make fun of me, not to mention the amount of times I've already lost her before, just for her to appear again... Gosh, I'm probably overexaggerating."

"Sounds abusive." He'd blow smoke from his mouth.

"But there's this thing, she loved me, I loved her back, she just had a weird way of expressing it. I tried talking to her about it one day but that never took off anywhere... It's strange, I feel relieved, yet empty at the same time." Ally finished her smoke, taking the cigarette butt and stomping it to the ground. "What about you? How was... never mind."

He tilted his head, but didn't really give it much thought. "Thanks for being around." He said, with a better sounding voice.

"Last person in the whole damn universe to be thanking someone." She chuckled. After a short silent moment she'd take a deep breath and ask,

"Say... would you rather fight, a hundred chicken-sized Citadelarians, or a thousand Citadelarian-sized chickens?"

Ferd didn't expect her to ask such a question, he gave it a thought.

"...I think I'd fight the thousand chickens, a hundred of small Citadelarians with their tech sounds lethal."

And the rest of the early morning was shared between them both, talking about whatever came into their minds.

Then the morning came, around eight o'clock.

Houston was sat in a makeshift cafeteria trying to make the best use of whatever was around. No luxury, no convenience. They made themself two delicious little sandwiches with too much lettuce and coffee, an ideal breakfast for a dude like them. They poured milk, put sugar, and stirred their coffee making unintentional loud noise with the spoon. Ferd and Ally both walked into the cafeteria together and sat themselves across Houston.

"Eh, long time no see Ferd!" They reached and spread their arms with a welcoming gesture, "I was wonderin' when we'd finally talk, wasn't easy getting you guys back in business." They went back to stirring their coffee, a little too aggressively.

"Why are you stirring your coffee like that." He immediately questioned.

"Y'see, I'm making art." They spoke with a smug attitude, "Ain't this damn sandwich beautiful?! Roasted bread, ham, lettuce, lettuce, lettuce, melted butter, salami, you dudes have more than I thought! For a scrap planet, at least..."

Houston stirred a little too hard, at the moment they pulled the spoon out a bit of coffee spilled across the table.

"Making art." Ferd was completely unamused as Houston rushed to get a napkin to clean the stains.

"Tell me more about you!" Ally was excited, "How'd you meet Ferd? How'd you become friends? Can you please give me that sandwich?"

"Woah, woah, slow down girl. There's a lot to unpack between us." They gestured with their hands, "To start off with the sandwich... I'm sorry, that one's for Ferd." They gave the sandwich to Ferd, on a fancy plate.

"I'm not hungry..." Ferd honestly stated, "You can have it if you want." He moved the plate to Ally's side, Houston was surprised.

"Ferd." She looked at him dead in the eyes, "Eat."

"I know you want this sandwich so bad, you're drooling." He insisted.

"Sure, I'll take a half." She smiled, "Thanks, but really, it was made for you."

She cut the sandwich in half terribly with a butter knife, intentionally not an exact half, she got the bigger slice. Houston had nothing to say, they were just a bit sour.

"So..." They started to speak, "How we came along Ferd, sounds like a fun topic." They crossed their arms, swinging on the chair.

"Yweaw mou whould wtawt." Ally nodded and spoke, Ferd slowly turned to her as she already had the whole half of the sandwich in her mouth.

"Me, okay." They took a moment to think, "I just stumbled upon this dude at a street, I was like 'Hey this guy's pretty damn famous!' and so I took him to places and took care, and then, you'd never believe it. I brought him to a museum where I taught him about the prophecies, and where I showed him the big grand project of the New Babylon. We ended up stealing it, the grand project is on his right arm! We got away from all the Babylon's forces, even my big boss Bill..."

Ally yawned.

"I thought you wanted to hear about this?" They questioned.

"So like, you're the reason the whole universe wants him now?" She wasn't exactly pleased by that story.

Awkward silence ensued at the table.

"It was my idea." Ferd spoke up, "Houston was just hanging around."

"Sure, I'll take that." Ally nodded.

"How's your story then?" They asked.

"Um..." Ally scratched her chin, "He just appeared at the odd place where I camped for a week or so. I took care, tended to his wounds, and eventually armed him to fend off against whatever was going at that world. We fought off Citadelarians, y'know the usual, and we kinda lost hard, good thing you came around!"

Ferd looked at her, but even he didn't really want to talk about what actually happened. Houston held a suspicious look.

"Well, best to get ready for the big journey." They sipped on their coffee, "The Disobedient's Capital, I forgot the name of it, we'll have to confront the big judge."

"Don't remind me." Ferd sighed.

"Oh, sorry." They immediately felt some guilt, "I was just... reminding y'all."

The table turned a bit somber. 

Ally nudged at Ferd, "Hey, don't forget you still got your sandwich." She spoke with a soft voice.
