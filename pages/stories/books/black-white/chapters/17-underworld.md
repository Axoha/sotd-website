Fireflies, one by one, rose up from the ashes and began to faintly highlight the edges of what existed. In the abyss, deep in the darkness, shadow leviathans swam across with their serpentine bodies. Examining and roaring to commune with one another. The echoes of every drop, every rock, every sound boomed through the whole abyss. That eerie peace would soon be broken as the children of the timelines began to wake.
Lips fumbled her bag, taking out a standard-issue rifle. Her body recently woke from the paralysis shot, amongst many others of the crew. They moved in silence, struggling to see in the faint darkness.

"Ferd, oh how good to see you again." Houston sighed in relief, dusting off their jacket, "That was a close one, you coulda been imprisoned for life!"

He raised an eyebrow, but didn't say anything to that, "Sure, nice to see you too."

"I didn't miss this place." Ally wondrously looked around, "What even happened?"

"Oh, right." They coughed into a fist, "Welcome! To the abyss! The barrier between a what I like to assume 'Heaven' and our world. This place is riddled with fascinating beasts, most sharing a common trope of darkness. They lurk, watch, sometimes even create..."

"How do they know that?" She whispered to Ferd.

"They've worked at a museum, surprisingly knowledgeable about all that whatever." He shrugged in response, "They told me about the creation of this universe or something, I hardly remember-"

"Anyway, let's get movin'." They finished their speech, "This is the queen's territory. Be wary, please."

That note slightly startled Ferd, snapping back and focusing again on the primary mission. They all began their expedition into the unknown as the fireflies intensified around, lighting the caverns even at the far distances. The leviathans flew among the pillars which held the surface of the worlds, their multiple mindless white eyes blinking. The floor was covered in thick snow, one that was not as unusual as the one in the monochrome region. Ally speeded her walk to reach Houston closely, holding something in her hand.

"Hey, Houston." She smiled.

"Uh, what's up?" They replied in a helpful tone.

"I wanna say, I don't know what's gotten into you back there, but it felt like you just became somewhat 'cooler'." She played with her hair, "Earlier today you didn't eve want to come close to me, and later you come up with this utterly insane idea of taping our hands together to climb into the sky!"

"When things get hot I believe silly things like my boundaries hardly matter." They smiled, "I was worried..."

"That was badass! We should totally do something like that again, unless that's what you actually do all the time and you never talked about it for some reason!" She chuckled.

"Yeah, stay tuned." They winked at her.

"Aw, lord." She stopped in her tracks, covering her mouth, "You're so totes cool, we're so besties now!"

"I-" Houston's face was hit by a snowball.

Ally maniacally laughed, "One and zero! Score for me baby!"

"That's how it is..." They rubbed the snow off of their face whilst preparing a snowball, "Eat this!"

They threw the snowball as hard as they could, Ally dodged it with relative ease, "Man, get your game-" She was hit in the face by another snowball from them.

They laughed back, "One to one."

This little confrontation would soon devolve into madness. Ferd just sat down on the snow, watching them both have a snowball fight. They both sculpted walls out of snow, serving as perfect cover while they prepped more and more snowballs to throw. Masy appeared from the darkness, walking towards Ferd ignorant of the constant score-boarding.

"Hey, Ferd..." She slowly looked towards the great battle of the abyss.

"Yeah." He numbly responded whilst checking out his glasses.

Houston and Ally stopped for a moment, forming a truce. "Who is that?" They both asked simultaneously. Ferd and Masy shared looks, unknowing to reply.

"Hi! I'm Masy!" She stepped off the pressure, "I've been following Ferd around, serving as a little assistant of some sort. You two must be great friends!"

Ally rushed over to Masy, crouching and gently shaking their little paw, "Oh my god, I'm Ally! Ferd I didn't know you had such a cute little companion!"

"I suppose that's who she is." He was confused, "She's nice."

Houston didn't come any closer to her. They faced Masy with a suspicious stare.

"So, anyway, Ferd as I was saying..." She looked directly into his eyes, "The queen is here, second contact happens at this place, I can guide you."

Loud silence ensued, the wind howled. "Guide me." Ferd nodded, reaching out a hand for Masy to grab and lead. Their expedition continued.

A gunshot echoed through the caverns.

"Take one more step and you'll eat all the lead!" Lips threatened, her gun barrel smoking. The rest of the Disobedient crew were behind, readied with their guns aimed at the special Babylon's black ops.

"Woah! Woah!" Bill jumped from the Babylon's side right into the middle of their sights, "Truce!"

"Give us a good reason, alien." Lips spat.

"Our weapons can't even kill, and without us you won't get out of here!" He yelled, "You've already terribly wounded our men and women, call for a ceasefire and we'll get out of here safely!"

The Disobedients looked at each other, sharing small whispers. "Fine." Lips called her gun down, "You're our prisoners now, jerks."

Bill sighed, he ordered with hand gestures for his team to dispose themselves of all weapons. Some of the crew came running to the unfamiliar technology immediately, scavenging on what was left on the floor.

"Boss this is a terrible idea what has gotten into you?!" Rose held his anger behind gritted teeth... if he had some.

"What's that, squirt?" Lips nudged the tip of her gun to his head, "Upset?"

He shook his head, he did not enjoy being under the lower classes' control.

Ally gave the distance a side-eye, curious to as if she heard something or not. She, Houston, and Ferd with Masy were all following a narrow white path, Houston being last. Some leviathans flew right above them, their blank white eyes forming strange thick tears which slowly fell and dissipated like as if it were snow, Ally watched the whole process and began to feel guilty for playing so much with it.

"The underworld." Masy spoke to fill in the silence, "It's our home, to the Inkas. The beautiful worlds outside rapidly age, it is not a good idea to stay here for extended periods."

"Why?" Ally asked from behind.

"A week has passed already." She looked back, "Not pleasant to hear for your mission due within the month, hm?"

"Oh." Her eyes widened, "That's really not good actually..."

Masy just shift her head down in response, "If anything, the hidden gates and stairs lead to any place you desire in this small universe."

They finally arrived at their destination, at the front of them laid a ruined colossal cathedral. Ferd stared at the ruins, reminiscing of his past experience in the abyss.

"Are there guardians here." He spoke.

"The dragons that swim around, they are. I told the sisters to ignore you." Masy looked back, looking at the leviathans that swam far at the back.

"Thanks..." He scratched his head, "Couldn't convince the previous guardian back then?"

"She was new, incredibly hotheaded. Sorry about that." She rubbed her cheeks, "You two, Ally and Houston, stay back here."

Houston looked offended, but Ally had an understanding reaction. Ferd and Masy entered the gaping entry of the ruined cathedral, and soon they disappeared in the darkness.

"Care for another snowball fight?" She suggested with a smile.

"No, I'm going in." Ruthlessly rejecting a fun time, they walked closer to the ruins.

"You've been acting weird since she came around!" She let some of her feelings out, "What's the matter?"

"Aren't you curious as well?" They looked at Ally.

She opened her mouth with the intent to say something, but stopped, deep inside she wanted to know what would happen. Houston smiled at her compliance, they began to scale the cracks in the walls to reach one of the many roofs, with Ally close behind.

"Ferd, are you nervous?" Masy asked, both of their footsteps and voices echoed throughout the hallway.

"I am." He spoke an honest thought.

"It has to be okay. I'm coming with you too." She reassured him, "The gauntlet's light damages her, maybe that's why she had such a harsh reaction. I'm sorry, I was too scared to go with you back then."

"It's fine." He replied, "How am I going to approach her? Wasn't the gauntlet already off back there?"

"It was not enough. I'll become one with your gauntlet this time, disabling it and rendering it invisible to her eye. The rest is up to you." And they stopped in their tracks, in front of a big door.

"Okay." He reached out his arm with the gauntlet to her, and Masy wasted no time melting into it. It hurt, like as if someone poured hot water. He winced and closed his eyes to suspend his pain, and after a few long seconds it was over. Masy's white eyes appeared from the dark silhouette the gauntlet became and blinked. Before he opened the door, an arm appeared from the silhouette and raised his glasses to his forehead.

He gently opened the door with a creak.

The Queen wept at the end of the sanctuary. Hearing her sobs, Ferd's anxiousness was more overcome by sadness. He stepped forward and closed the door behind him. He slowly followed the white carpet, passing by all the empty pew benches, the stained glass lit up with a white light, and her weeping came to a halt. She raised her head and swiftly turned her eye to Ferd, who stopped and cautiously stood at the middle of the sanctuary.

"Ena." He softly spoke, "It's me."

The Queen's body turned to him, the sound of bones cracking sound as she moved closer and closer to him. Her thin legs and arms, crawling up to him. Her head was defined by nothing but a skull, with two blank white eyes and thick gray hair that sprawled up to her tail. She came close to him, slightly too close for comfort, her chin oozed of black liquid which dropped right onto his fur. They directly stared into each others' eyes for a moment.

"It's still just you, isn't it?" He spoke with a frown, "Sometimes when you'd be really upset, you'd just close yourself inside of our room and play songs."

Looking at her eyes for a long time made him a little dizzy, he directed his sight towards an organ, which she was crying at the front of.

"It's still you." A tear fell from his eye, he reached out his arms to tightly hug her. "I don't care what happened, let's just go back home..." And tears after tears he cried into her shoulder of nothingness.

"Target set." A sniper rifle was fired with a powerful shot which intensively echoed through the sanctuary. A single bullet flew straight into the Queen's head.
