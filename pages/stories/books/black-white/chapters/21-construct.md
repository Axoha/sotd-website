"A small axolotl, just like Isaac." Ally sighed, "Not surprising, no wonder they're such buddies as we've been told."

Isaac jumped off Vlad's shoulder, coming down to greet Wall with lots of friendly blabbering on the table. Handshakes, hugs, no one could understand them.

"New faces, who could these be?" A muffled deep voice came from the side.

"Who? Huh?" Houston looked around.

"That is an Architect species, Hano, kept in the fridge." Vlad crossed his arms, "Wall has been looking for a suitable body."

"How could they see us?!" Houston grew more confused.

"Architects are like that." He looked at them.

"Sounds cool!" Ally overheard the conversation and went over to open one of the many refrigerators in the room before being abruptly stopped by Wall blabbering absolute nonsense.

"He can't talk." Isaac gestured, "And you don't want to open that fridge, trust me."

"Okay then." She shrugged it off like nothing.

Ferd eyed the body that laid on the steel frame. A beast with black fur which bled into purple, enhanced with cybernetic organs. A surgery was performed here, gross. He eyed the smaller details, and noticed the symbol of the Citadel on one of its ears.

"Hey." He spoke up, "What's all this about?"

Wall crawled from the table onto a stool next to the frame. He nabbed a thick notebook and handed it over to Ferd, opened on a specific page. It was filled with morbidly detailed sketches, no words. There were skulls, little black bears, and the whole anatomy of the beast on the frame. It was hard to understand, but the inclusion of Inka's helped him realize what was going on. Wall then shuffled through his many cabinets, asking to come on Vlad's shoulder as he struggled to open the topmost shelves.

"So, Isaac, how did you meet this little blubby?" She comfortably sat down, ignoring the beast.

"Ah, it was years ago. Me n' Vlad came around this city before it was fully built and we found him in these ruined catacombs as I like to call it." He took a chocolate bar out of a drawer and munched on it, "Full on base was set here, no joke! It was a surprising turn of events especially since axolotls like me are incredibly rare. We quickly became good buddies, we offered support, and so did he..."

Wall exclaimed proudly as he finally grabbed what seemed to be a flask full of black liquid. He crawled over to Ferd and came close to him, the fluid immediately retracting away from the gauntlet. Wall looked with fascination, something like that never occurred here before. He nabbed the notebook from Ferd's hands and immediately began sketching again. Ferd, bored, looked at the beast again and noticed a scratched label next to the symbol - 'Juno'.

"There is not much time." Vlad leant over to Wall, "Please, show us what you believe would help us."

Wall got off the sketching immediately, dashing over to grab a whiteboard from the side with vital information drawn on it. The dots began to connect, the beast roamed the city before being hunted and seriously injured, its body was found by Wall days later and fixed. Apparently, this is a beast unlike any other, it has special encrypted memories recorded in its mind and an unknown element fused with its blood. All they had to do now was wake it with a careful electric shock to access its memory. Everyone gathered around the steel frame. Wall dashed to connect multiple wires into its beating heart, right before blitzing to the back of the room with the wielder's mask on his face. He laughed maniacally as he flipped the switch. All the lights flickered and went out for a long moment, turning back on a minute later.

Ally darted her big eyes to Houston and Ferd and burst out laughing, their fur standing up from the sudden high level of electricity.

"Citadel Vitamin Corp!" A robotic voice sang with a catchy jingle played from the beast's head, the Citadel's symbol appeared and rotated as the system boot up. Vlad decided to back away.

The system finished booting up, and with a few scratchy inner noises, digital nostrils, eyes, and a mouth appeared on the beast's blank face. Like as if nothing happened, it hardly moved its arms and removed the connected wire like nothing, calmly. It groaned, scratching its head. 

"HABBAHWBA!!!" Wall rejoiced and laughed for the final step, holding two wires in his little grubby hands. In a swift move he got behind the beast and stabbed it directly into the back of her head to strike the encrypted mind at its weakest moment.

"THE MONSTER!!! THE QUEEN!!! DO NOT CONSUME IT!!!" It screams out, its breathing heavy and ragged. The lights flickered, pieces of it began spazzing out, everything was getting unstable fast. With tremendous force, it grabs the wire connected to its head and rips it out. It shook in fear, once the lights went dark it appeared at random places within the room. Suddenly it vanished completely at the next flicker.
Wall stomps on the ground in frustration, immediately speaking in gibberish pointing fingers at the trio and the door. The memory download was botched, corrupted, he wanted the beast here again right now.
And they were booted out of the room. The trio, together with Vlad and Isaac rush back into the nightclub as they call their fellow crew about the status. Opening the door back into the main dance room, nothing out of the ordinary. People danced, drank, listened to insanely loud music. Ferd squinted his eyes at what they were even drinking, he came closer without hesitation to grab whatever bottle a stranger held shoving them away... The liquid moved away from his gauntlet. Ally ran up to him to ask what gotten into him, but it all dawned on him. People were possessed by this matter, drinking it, covered by it. His ears rang, Ally's concerned voice fading out as he focused on the surrounding...

The entrance was bust down by a group dressed in black, stylish clothes. Without a voice, they readied their shotguns and began firing at anyone they saw. Vlad in a first instinct grabbed everyone with a swing and hid behind a counter.

"We need to get out of here!" Houston's heart beat out of their chest, "This must be a damn vampire's den!"

Ally was just as equally freaked out, but Ferd was more focused. A stranger leaps at Houston, their whole body partially covered by black matter. They were fast, deadly, inhumane, their appearance could not be easily described. Houston kicked in complete utter panic before Vlad managed to grab it by its throat to throw at the back. Despite all the chaos, the local DJ continued making her rave music. Ferd peeked out of the counter, calling out the rest of the team to move behind his gauntlet. They began crawling from table to table, sometimes clumsily rolling. Houston's legs were quickly snatched by a vampire, but its head was immediately blasted. A hunter slid by, eyeing the whole group. They didn't say much, just nodded in acknowledgment and tossed a spare shotgun for Houston. They fought with blades, guns, but the team needed to move. The flashing strobe lights in the darkness made it hard to see, the vampires could be anywhere they wanted. They slowly got closer to the exit, and once they were near enough Ally made a run for it upstairs into the surface. She tumbled on the concrete pavement out of breath with the rest right behind her.

"Never again." She gasped, "No, no, I did not like that. I want to go home."

The team walked a few more streets until they eventually settled down to rest. After a bit, Ferd went through Houston's bag to find a notebook. Remote heavy sentries, two shotguns, a stuffed toy, and a lot of tactical gadgets. He found their small notebook and began jotting down notes with their pen as well. The Disobedient crew got in contact with Wall, and the tracker that was placed on the beast was broadcast live. It was spazzing out across the whole city, not due to a programming fault.

"Consumption of the fluid..." He murmured as he wrote, "Possible attraction for the Inka... Vitamin Citadel Corp... Masy's sight... Addiction?.. Enhanced powers... Guardians..."

Houston leant over to see what's up, "What are you doing?"

He didn't respond, instead he took out his communicator device and called Lips. "Were all the monochrome regions made within the Citadel's territory?" He asked in a bold tone once his call was picked up.

Lips picked up the call, flying above the city in an extraction ship with her hair waving. "No? Everyone was hit."

"Well shucks, stay with me." He was focused, crossing out a possible speculation, "What is the Citadel Vitamin Corp? Is there any information we have!"

"Big distributor, usually associated with medical drugs and groceries. What's up with these questions?!" She got slightly annoyed.

"Are there any more ties between the Babylon and the Citadel. Final question." He boldly asked.

The call was abruptly with to a signal loss. He continued to jot down notes until he put too much pressure on the pen with his gauntlet, exploding and covering the entire page in ink. He groaned in frustration, slamming the notebook onto the cold concrete floor. Houston was busy tending to their gadgets, Vlad and Isaac were playing rock paper scissors, and Ally... she was sat, resting her head on her arms which were crossed on the knees. She was looking down, bothered. Seeing her like that, Ferd decided to sit next to her, also upset.

"...Can I look at the notebook?" She calmly asked, her voice hoarse.

"...Yeah, sure." Ferd reached out to the notebook, opening the page to where the ink was splattered.

"...And the pen, too?" She looked with pleading eyes.

He looked at her with a jaded look, but gave her the pen anyway, already dried.

"Thanks..." She turned back away from him, doing something with the notebook and the pen for a surprise. Ferd raised his head to see, but Ally always sensed it and obscured his view every time he tried.

"BAM!" She suddenly turned to Ferd, "Look at her! She's here to guide us once more, with her infinite wisdom, we'll get the answer to it all in no time!" The page splattered in ink was cut out terribly in the shape of Masy, paired with blank pages stuck to the silhouette to serve as the long and wavy white hair. Can't forget her two little white eyes, of course.

He carefully took the paper craft into his hands, "That's just like her."

"You think, if you raise it into the sky with your gauntlet and call out her name, will it summon her?" She tilted her head.

"I wouldn't be surprised." He tenderly put her into his pocket, "She'll make for a good pocket friend in the meantime."

Moments later, Houston received a call. The beast's trajectory was now properly set.
