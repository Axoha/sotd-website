All feels like a fading memory, doesn't it? Today vanishes, tomorrow never happens. All feels hollow.

*That replacement of your heart is taking a grand toll on you, hm?*

I don't know how to feel about gaining such power.

*Rila...*

I don't know how to feel about being a *demon*.

*Why?*

I feel like life just doesn't exist to me anymore. I'm immortal, my only purpose now is to destroy. Anything I touch turns to dust, I don't like this!

*Oh, Rila...*
*When you surround yourself with such negative thought, of course it will affect the way you see life.*
*Calm your mind, open your palm, imagine whatever you desire.*

But why? What's the meaning behind all this?

*Trust me.*

`The unstable claw which destroys opens up.`
`The harsh exterior which streamed like ink cracks and breaks, her real hand is set free.`

*You desire freedom.*

...

*Rila, the secret to freedom...*

`The mechanical hand which creates opens up.`
`White ooze comes flowing from the veins. A glowing sphere of light whirls atop the palm before a key is brought into existence.`

*Create your own key. Let's open the gates of this palace together.*

`The hesitant hand follows the same. A key is made of awful quality.`
`Despite the shoddy nature and unfitting shape, it comes to be a perfect fit.`

I can... create.

*Rila, you are an author.*


**ACT III CHAPTER XI - RILA III "HEART TO HEART"**

A shining light appeared in the void, a call. My Ferd, yelling out for help in a desperate voice. I wake, from a state where I'm nothing but everything. Where I see but don't see. Where I live but don't live. I reach out to the light, somehow, without any hand. I thought I was dead, gone, my story already long over.

The wind howls, artillery and cannons at constant fire. I take my time to look at myself, oh how he has grown, and the surroundings of course. How time has just slowed. Everything in this world is what the Holy Earth has been looking for, but it seemed like the Bastioners have reached the divinity sooner - again. I thought those Bastioners were already extinct. 

I am so confused.

"Okay... *Rila*. Where is Ferd?!" A voice in my mind speaks.

"Likely in a coma, he's fine." I ready myself, "Fill me in, let's clean this mess."

She wanted to ask a lot. The giant beast before us woke from the strike, "We are ordered to kill that!" She cut off all her thought to inform me of that.

"The sisters..." I mutter, "What's the Bastion doing with the Inka?"

"The Bastion? What!?" She squeaked back at me.

"What do you mean what. Girl these are green cyborgs known as the 'Bastioners' and they used to be the-"

"Citadelarians!" She began to argue with me, "Whoever the hell you are, you're getting everything wrong! Get out of his body!"

I turned my left hand into a claw, which I used to submerge into the gauntlet to take out the black ooze. Ally morphs from the ink, and I finally get to see her form. She was confused, injured, big-eyed. As the beast continued to wake, I hide the both of us behind the ruins of a building. I raise the gauntlet into the air, reach out to his heart, and conjure raw beef into existence. The meat benchmark never fails me, I bite into the beef and tear a huge chunk, eating like a damn rabid animal.

"You're EATING?!" She disrupts my delightful feast.

"Gauntlet works." I spout, "Here, have the rest..." She instantly refused without saying a word.

I look back at the giant from behind a wall, looks to be actively searching for us.

"What's your name again?" I ask.

"It's Ally, why?"

"Lovely to meet you, Ally. Give me one of those transmitters and tell me all the channels." An amazing plan came into mind.

"I don't know how to feel about you being in Ferd." She spoke from her sincere uncomfortable expression.

I suppose she was right. In a quick moment I morphed into the real me. This won't last, hopefully.

"Gosh you're so pretty..." She said with dazzled eyes.

"Save that for later." It felt weird to wield the gauntlet, but I felt more at ease with this form. Thanks.

I did not recognize the army which follows a four-winged bird, more notably the lost Angel of peace. I did not recognize whatever tech the apparent Citadel has. A reconstruction event had to happen. Ferds' fur marks were black, but that may be due to this world being shrouded monochrome. I'll do whatever it takes to help my dear son.

--

*"Besides..." I sniffled and sobbed, barely even speaking anymore, "We will meet again, I'm sure of it."*

*"Then... why are you so sad?" He felt his own tears flow.*

*"I don't want to say goodbye, I wanted to live a life taking care of you, away from all the terror for once." I smiled, "But I wish for the people to even have an opportunity for similar dreams."*

*"Mom..." He looked at me with teary eyes, "You would've been the greatest Angel."*

--

I'm-
"So... what's the plan?" Ally asks me. I was zoned out for a bit, taking in the whole thing, looking at my glasses he somehow kept this whole time.

I tell her, "Get me connected, I'll want contact with the big guns."

She hands me over her transmitter, really outdated, you have to be kidding me, this thing is probably a thousand years old by now. One step cleared.

"Now, get on my back." I order.

"What?" I shouldn't be as surprised about that answer.

There was no time to waste anymore, my whole body shift into terror. I grab her and ensure she's on my back at my beastly form.

"COVER ME." God, there was no other way to pronounce that better in this shape.

She hangs tight on my back, and I immediately leap into the battlefield. It's only apparent we are the same, but she sucks at it. As I crawl through the heads of the troops, blitzing through the fire in nothing but a blink, I hear the radio open up with confused chatter. How I am going to open up to these folks is gonna be a hurdle that'll slam me anytime soon.

"Can I ask, who WHO are you?!" Surprisingly, in the heat of battle she manages to ask.

"LET'S START WITH A SIMPLE FACT." I pierce and shred through the Citadelarians, their weapons lacking. I take a moment to tear the shell off my mouth to clear my speech, "I'm Ferd's original mother."

"I didn't know you'd be this crazy!" She spoke through her struggle.

"I was adopted by the leaders of a 'Holy Earth'..." I continued to tell her all about me amidst the battle, "...one huge golden civilization of-"

"You mean the New Babylon? I had a friend who'd talk about it a couple of times!" She rudely interrupted me, but I never expected to hear this. The New Babylon lives and prospers, that is wonderful. So many of those Citadel walkers obfuscated our track, I needed to come up with something.

"Before the New Babylon." I correct her as I slam a Citadelarian into the ground, "I come from the Holy Earth, which does not exist anymore. A reconstruction event had to have happened... but not exactly a complete one."

"Woah woah elaborate!" Of course she wouldn't know.

"The reconstruction happens once a sacred divine rule is broken where God appears to erase everything to start existence over." I take a deep breath, "Back to my story that you wanted to hear..."

She didn't have anything to say, odd.

"I was paired with a guy since childhood, Akimi, really lovely and dorky. Then a duo, mother and father of Ferdinand, someone we'll get to later. The Holy Earth was once an imperial militaristic civilization that controlled the whole universe at one point, we were groomed to become an experimental squad set to do various tactical missions to ensure whatever 'rule' and 'religion' was brought in all the worlds..." The assumed 'Genkatan' fires at us again, we need to assimilate with the crowds and relocate fast, "One time we all tried to escape, and we were close! But a Guardian Angel, a grand divine being which ensures all is right, appeared at the Holy Earth to destroy it all..!"

"I met Ferdinand once..." She said scratching her chin. Oh my, he lives.

Time was seriously running out, my story was far too long. I quit out of it, I was getting too distracted. I overhear coordinates, figure out the whole map of the place in mind, now was the best time to start making tactical moves. I tap into the transmitter, "Enemy walker, B-12, red walker from the fourth chain fire now!"

"Who are you!?"

Frustrated, I make my way into the fourth chain's den. I leap onto the walker, sticking to the pilot's window in my beastly form with Ally on my back.

"Destroy that walker! It's literally the key to advancing forward! What are you waiting for?!" I yell into the transmitter, pointing directly at the one specific Bastioner- Citadelarian walker for their eyes. 

They didn't comply.

I start breaking the window with a fist, I felt Ally try to stop me. Once the surprisingly durable glass shattered, I tumble over to knock those red guys off the main seats for myself. So many buttons, none of these follow the universal language of machines! Ally got off my back to take the other seat, she wasn't so delighted with me doing that. 

"You look like you know how these work, teach me." I told her.

Getting off the seat to walk towards me, "This button does that, this switch does this, that lever does it." Great.

Never-mind I was starting to get it. That light-matter cannon couldn't be operated with just a single person, and Ally already knew that. She assisted me with rotation, inputs, whatever junk, and we fired. I would lie if I thought that this wasn't bringing me back to the gold days. Once those walkers were out of the equation, I tell her to get back on me to finally confront the giant face to face. Before we'd leap into the unknown, I'd take some of my sweet time harshly dislodging the cannon from the ant, for personal use of course.

I leapt into the bath of the stars, the pitch-black sky. Carefully looking over at each detail, at the current situation, the Genkatan stood looming over the crater as usual... something seemed familiar of this place. I extended wings from my back, I couldn't fly, but I could glide in this state. My beastly body adapted to the air, turning the tendrils of my skin into feathers to aid my flight and insulate against the unforgiving cold.

"What about your story, darling?" I stop the silence. She kept looking up and down with wonder, I could tell.

"Um..." She thought, "I met Ferd at a monochrome region, unconscious. He appeared during my journey for finding someone special, turns out they were finding someone special too."

"What? Is this romance I am hearing?" I found her start pretty funny.

"N-No!?" She covered her face, "It's nothing like that! He's just a friend!"

"...Anyway, continue." I was willing to hear more, chuckling.

It took her a while to pick up her speech, "...So his 'wife', Ena, turns out she's this Queen of all the Inka. He lost her before finding his way here, and she turned out to be this beast similar to you..."

Ena... I recognize that name.

"Then when all seemed lost we were picked up by his previous buddies, like, the Disobedient or 'red guys' as you call them. The following month was all about looking for the Queen while figuring out what was even happening. On the last day, on the 'last' mission, Ena and Ferd managed to merge into this absolute divine being that was coming to save us all! But, that was short lived, that Genkatan appeared and all of us lost the battle." She pointed at the giant below us.

I look at the gauntlet embedded to my right arm, the reason why I couldn't morph into a being that could properly fly. Could it be? No, no way, Ferd being involved in the prophecy of black and white?

"Then we were stuck in prison for a month or so, but I broke my way out! BUT before I could even do something, Ferd was doing something else in the lowest level? He looked devastated, destroyed, with Ferdinand laying next to him. That time in the prison changed him, I had to take care of him while we were in the New Babylon. He was going crazy about that gauntlet!"

"You better have taken the best care."

"I have." She nodded, "Don't worry, he was my whole priority for the time."

Everything must've been so hard for him...

"Then..." She continued, silently thinking for a moment, "...we were assigned a mission to go here, to kill the giant."

"That's pretty short." I point out, "You're on my good side, darling. Hang tight."

I dive down into the battlefield right onto the giant. It was time, with our combined powers, with my cannon, we'd make quick work of this abomination. Getting to land right on the shoulder, I shrug Ally off my back and urge her to rush up to its head.

*G:\MIND\VOICEBOX\model >v3*
**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHAT MODEL SELECTED, I WILL TALK ON MY OWN : : : )**

Lord, that came with a deafeningly loud sound. What was that? Why is it doing that? It's looking right at us with those ominous six dots, what is it gonna do with its slow movements while we're on its shoulder... I told Ally to rush to her face and blow her eyes off with fireworks from her hands, a usual strategy I prefer. Surprising that she already knew that, hm.

"With my sincerest apology - I could not fulfill your request of terminating the subject 'Rila', as that person does not exist. Maybe you mispronounced the name, or try requesting a different person?"

Oh, it's one of *THOSE* bots. I follow Ally, making sure she won't get hurt while climbing on its face. Does it really not have any defense mechanism?

"The subject 'Rila' does not exist. Please try-" And her eyes were starting to explode thanks to Ally, about time. I drop on one of the many catwalks embedded to this giant, finally getting to charge the cannon in hand to deal damage.

"Major damage detected. Turning on self-defense." Speak of the devil, it shut its eyes.

From literally everywhere, sentries and guns rose from its dark body as if it came out of each skin pore. Fire immediately ensued, I drop the cannon to snatch Ally from its face to protect her. The beams were barely avoidable, she was hit up to four times, I was hit more but I could endure. With the gauntlet I form a bubble to protect from incoming fire, but even that was hopeless, strange teleporting skinny Bastioner- Citadelarians appeared to ward us away. She clung onto my body, not on my back this time. I drop down from the catwalks to the ground far below, clawing at her body and legs to reduce momentum as we fell. Those beams were made of light matter, but not the strong kind.

"It hurts..." She silently tells me from beneath my chin.

I find another ruined building. I leap into it, start immediately looking for any doors leading to the underground. Lucky, a manhole, I open it to jump into the darkness as my tendril takes care of closing it.

"Let's see your situation..." The rumbles of the Genkatans stomps were incredibly unnerving, Ally was completely shook from what just happened. We can't stay here for long, I know that giant will tear down this whole building and its underground soon.

"You're not a soldier, are you?" I ask her, it was pretty clear. Her knee, neck, left shoulder, right hand were all pierced with massive wounds. These would all just simply regenerate over time but... she wasn't used to it. I got the gauntlet to work, creating fabric to wrap around the wounds, slowly soothing the pain.

"Why were you in a frame." She spoke with a rasp voice, "In a main cathedral, somewhere in the underworld."

A frame?

"It completely slid off my mind..." She rubbed her face, "There was a portrait, Rila Jones, it was you, among many others."

That must've been so long ago, oh, I remember. The time when I was brought to a palace by the King shortly after the operation to turn me into Rila. The time when I was still learning, feeling like a child guided by the masters. The plains of white grass and blue sky, a single pink cherry tree, and the castle, the palace. Where I got to learn about the first prophecy, the Inka, where...

"Are you okay?" She asked me with a concerned look.

"Oh, I am okay dear." I quickly find my words to reply, "You should stay, and when your wounds are gone, you should go." I wondered, what was she doing in the cathedral?

"What do you mean?"

I look at her body again, she was in no state to fight. Not experienced, tired, wounded. Taking on the giant alone would be a daunting task, but I'll find my way. "I will destroy that Genkatan, for you both."

"I can't help?!" She raised her voice.

"Look at yourself, come on."

"I guess you're right..." Her eyes drifted away.

"Ally." I gently touch her chin, raising her head, "You've already done so much for me."

She was surprised, without words. I take my sunglasses off, "The final best way to help me, keep these glasses in safe hands for Ferd. They don't deserve another beating."

"Is this a goodbye?" Her tone got sadder, oh how I hate these farewells. I tackled her with a hug, "Continue taking good care of Ferd for me, will you?" I blurted out before getting sadder.

"I will, ma'am." She hugged me back, even through all the pain.

"I know you'll think of me as Rila, the almighty demon who's in for total carnage... but I hope you'll remember me as Emilia, it's my personal name, and who I actually am."

"Always thought Rila was an odd name." She smiled.

I got up, gave her the glasses, and told my farewells. I love you, Ally. I wish I could spend more time in this new world...
But here comes the carnage. 
I find my way to the surface, the Genkatan slowly turns its head to me. The six starry eyes light up, and its right arm sparks with static. My cheek cracks with dust, I need to hurry. With a strike equivalent of a mass detonation, the giant blows the ground with its fist. I evade and with tendrils I latch onto its arm, climbing my way up to its face once more. The sentries rise up, with the gauntlet I create a bubble similar to a mirror, deflecting many of the incoming shots. I grab onto the catwalks, again and again. The known 'retainers' vanish and appear, no match for me. The bullets graze me, not an issue. Alarms blare, nothing is overwhelming for me. My limbs stretch to no bound.

"Unintelligible, unintelligible." It's booming voice sounds, "Fixing... Fixing..."

I finally get up to one of the catwalks hanging around its neck. "Intruder."

The fire stopped. With its slow head movements, limbs grew from its body to apprehend me. Oh, there was no other choice, with a leap I charge the gauntlet and smash the center of its face. A critical hit, but not enough, I needed to go further. I stretch the gaping wound in its face and fit myself inside, I will destroy her from the inside. The head was hollow, dark, a massive super-computer in the shape of a brain pulsated at the center. The inside lit up and all the possible defense mechanisms triggered, I needed to get it over with fast, I know destroying this still wouldn't be enough.

"Incoming voice... Incoming voice..."
"WHATEVER YOU ARE!!! STOP THIS!!! MY LIFE'S WORK?! MY DREAM! MY LOVE! DON'T YOU DARE DESTROY-"

With a simple jab I take out the speakers, I could not care less for the creator's word. The computer shielded itself in a bubble, laser beams flashed place to place. I leap from one wall to another, revolving around the computer as I scrap all the possible tech that looked important. The bubble flickered, I was doing well. The cannons fired, the lasers flashed, chaos, total chaos, my ears rang. Once the bubble was down I took no time to throw myself and pierce right through the computer. The giant shook, roaring in absolute agony, perhaps there was conscience to it. With the gauntlet I tear apart the doors to the lower levels, the neck, the collarbones, the main core. My body cracked more with each passing second that flew, it needed to be over *FAST*. I dived into the hollow void of the neck, and there it was, the glowing core of each divine being. I waste no time, fabricating spears and weapons to crack and shatter the fragile piece. Alarms blared more, the roars of the Genkatan continued to fill the atmosphere. It began to tremble frantically, my body was thrown off the ground to be tossed inside the empty shell of the giant. The Genkatan began to tore itself apart, it cried in pain, it tore its chest just to apprehend me. The Disobedient firing at it right now didn't help either, it leant down and I was doomed to fall from the opening wound it made for itself. I manage to grab onto a broken catwalk, and there, it looked at me with tears streaming from its eyes. Explosions, even more chaos, I get ahold of myself and throw myself back into the chest to finish the job. Retainers appeared, sentries rose, limbs grew, a wave of everything thrown directly at me. My legs began to spaz out, static filled my organs, but in the brink of time I manage to throw myself at the core one more time to shatter the heart. The interior began to explode, all the components self-destructing. I calculated an approximate of twenty seconds before it'd be gone for good. My limbs began to crack, the shell was falling apart completely. I stretch my limbs across the opening to slingshot myself out of the assumed explosion radius...
It's coming to an end, oh, I saw myself falling apart as I flew through the winds. I turn in the air to look at the giant right before it blew up in light. Hectic, reminds me of my glory days.

I wrap myself in protective cover, there was no time for me here anymore. My skin corroded into sparkles and butterflies as I flew.

Oh, how I'll miss living again.
