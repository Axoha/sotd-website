Ferd woke up the next day, all nicely tucked up in his bed. There was some breakfast for him right besides his bed, unusual. He took great delight in drinking the morning coffee and eating the sandwich, composed of his favorite ingredients (most notably tuna). Last night felt like a dream, not remembering exactly what happened, he walked outside and downstairs to meet Ena. He woke up late this day.

But she wasn't there, at her usual resting spot.

He raised an eyebrow, he felt something really odd was happening. He asked around some of the allies around if they have seen her, everyone gave the same response of shaking their heads and saying no. He went out to the one spacious shack with the television and all sorts of recreation stuff.

But she wasn't there, not even being lazy how she usually is.

He was confused, he went back into his home. All of her stuff, collectibles, clothes, were still at the same spot. She had to have been around somewhere. The Big Ant was getting fixed up outside, maybe she would participate at restoring the machine.

But she simply wasn't anywhere.

Oh, he was getting worried. He started asking many of his fellow allies, nobody had a clue. He came around to even ask the big guy, Vlad, who unfortunately had nothing to say either. The only possible idea was that there could've been a private deal between her and Lips, for that to know he'd have to ask *her*.

"What is it, you little fuzzball?" The great commander was busy writing and signing documents, seemingly irritated as usual.

Ferd gulped, "Ena, she's missing."

"Ena..." She'd sigh, "...my favorite little ally, you better not tell me she went absent without leave."

"That's the strangest part, she didn't!" He let his confused feelings come, "All her belongings are still around, it's like as if she just vanished overnight!"

She turned around to him and thought, she was confused as well. "You know, you're handling it well. If it were for me to suddenly lose someone like that, nobody would rest around here for months!"

"...Lose?" That word triggered Ferd's mind, "Don't say that!?"

"Look." She grabbed his shoulder, "She isn't here." She talked with a serious tone, a sharp stare. "Something odd like this could be alluding to an abduction, all sorts of uncomfortable stuff."

Ferd looked at her with disbelief in his eyes, he had nothing to say.

She let go of his shoulder, turned to her computer monitor to do something quick. Dragging windows, files, replying to messages. She pulled a USB disc from the computer and handed it over to him, "This stick has the entirety of last night's camera footage, I would start the search from here. That's my direct order for you."

He held the USB close to his face, he left without saying anything but a single small thanks.

"...good news, today is the national 'Water Burger' day, hyper-experts claim..."

The television ran news as usual in the spacious recreation room of their sanctuary. Ferd booted up the local computer and plugged the disc in, ready to watch the whole eight hours of camera footage in one sitting. Fellow allies were huddled up on the couch not far away, they looked at him and then turned to each other, gossiping about whatever.

"...several scrap planets receive tons of resources after multiple operations were conducted on Citadelarian planets to gather for stronger defenses. Known commanders state, the success rate out of the seventy-two missions was only a measly fifty-percent..."

"...New Babylon begins to reveal their secret project, the 'New Age' as they call it. A surviving golden relic from an unknown time in history has been put on display at the largest museum built within the New Babylon itself. Heavily protected, the team behind the secret project hint that the item may be the key to uncovering something that could change everything..."

"...higher Disobedient war commanders are testing the effectiveness of the new *'WB-131 Type 2'*. After criticism of the previous 'WB-131' not looking like its nickname 'Ant', the higher ranks have designed a new iteration that give it slanted legs and better mobility overall..."

"...Dawn of the Green Light has immediately cut all and any contact with the Disobedient after a failed transaction, no one is sure what could happen next..."

Time seemed to have move fast on its own, the sun quickly dropped down as Ferd was still stuck on his seat like a corpse. No one was watching the television anymore, he was all alone in the recreation room.

"...it is summer time, best time to put on your glasses..."

Even though no one was in the room, the television was still turned on.

"...and sunscreen..."

There were some silly sounds coming from the television, Ferd finally paused his recording and walked up to check what was going on.

"...vacations, only now for..."

Ferd decided to lay down on the couch, it hurt to stand and sit after being on the computer all day.

"On today's schedule, we have the following..."

*20:10 - Weather report*
*20:35 - The Adventures of Masy*
*22:10 - CHRISTFORARMS VII - Lucifer Begone!*
*23:50 - Disobedient Anthem*

He had nothing to do either way, he stuck by to watch the television. The screensaver on the local computer turned on, a blank screen with bubbles floating all over.

"...That's all for today's weather report of multiple solar systems, thank you for standing by!"

The screen turned into loud static, before suddenly being tuned into a movie.

*THE ADVENTURES OF MASY*

*A colorful movie aimed for everyone, but mostly younger audiences. A cute little character appears who's name is Masy. She's an oddly designed black bear with long white hair, friends with many other small anthropomorphs like her, they go on silly adventures together and beat up the evil forces of the dark, fantasy-style.*

"I'll watch anything, I guess." Like dead on the couch, he stared at the screen as the colorful scenes continued to play out.

*Masy was the bravest of them all, but also the most reckless and clumsiest. She'd always get herself in lots of trouble, her friends always eventually saving her. Ferd hated to admit it, but he was getting invested, and also emotional. For the ending acts of the film, Masy and her friends gathered to take down the big antagonist boss in an epic sequence of friendship and teamwork. All the character development and all the tense scenes would finally pay off. Ferd was physically melting into the couch as he watched. As Masy smiled at the screen, he could not think of anyone else but Ena. He was starting to get visibly upset, his heart ached at her absence. He looked away from the screen, into the ceiling, silent in his own thoughts. The movie was about to end, anyway.* 

..?

*Masy walked closer to the camera, getting her face all over the screen, looking around the room Ferd was laying in. Complete darkness, she knocked on the screen three times.*

He looked back at the television and was slightly shocked, the main character of the movie he just watched was staring at him, smiling.

"You could try smiling, too!" She spoke with a happy tone.

"...Me?" Pointing at himself, he was confused.

"Yes, you!" She threw her hands up in joy, "Don't make me come out there and beat the soul out of you!"

"What are you- How are you- What is going on?!" He sat up, eerily confused.

"I'm Masy, don't you know?" She tilted her head, "You should know all about this, you've been in a *GAME* before, haven't you?"

"Y-yes, I have." He looked to the side, grabbing his right arm.

"I don't know how you could refer to me for you to understand." She raised an eyebrow, "I believe you'll figure out later."

From this point on, it's as if the entire world around him turned monochrome. The focus was on the screen, nowhere else.

"I want to help you out." She directly stated, "Your heart pains for her, we know exactly who. Your situation is so hopeless, stranded in the middle of nowhere without a way out."

The screen suddenly turned back into its loud static.

"But this is a special situation." She suddenly appeared right besides Ferd, sitting on the couch. He was cautious but willing to listen.

"She is not dead." She observed Ferd's body, "I know this, I can guarantee you that."

"Masy..." He was calm, "What are you here to tell me, apparently?"

"A clue." She smiled, "That's how I want to help you out."

"What's the clue? How can I get back to her?" He started asking more questions.

"Oh, it won't be that simple." She looked down, "For the clue, just put on the item that makes the worlds go monochrome."

"...My glasses?" He pointed at his forehead.

"You have them on right now!" She laughed, "I'm just kidding! I'm not the one for clues either way! Just reach the Babylon and fate will find its way to you!"

"You confuse me." He shook his head, "Is it certain? Are you setting me up for something?"

"No, no. That was the truth. There is nothing more to say, reach the Babylon. From there, the ki-"

"Oh, Ferd, surprising to see you here, watching television." Vlad came into the room.

Suddenly, Masy was nowhere to be seen. Ferd frantically looked back and forth, "Uh..."

"Watching animated movies, oh, I get that." He walked closer to the couch, leaning down to see what's on the screen. There was Masy, tending to a garden like as if nothing happened.

"Uh, yeah." He looked down.

"It's rough, isn't it." He bent over the couch, "I remember watching some old animated eastern shows from my childhood when I was at my lowest. It's awkward, but it heals the soul."

Ferd was surprised at how close Vlad was, "I suppose so."

"It's not being talked about much, but everyone is worried." He sighed, "Even I, but that's just how it goes."

The rest of the night was shared in small exchanges between Vlad and Ferd, before they both eventually went back into their homes to sleep. The moon was full, it's light strong. Ferd couldn't get himself to sleep as half of his bed was empty.

At around three in the morning, Ferd snuck out of the curfew outside into a field used for primarily extraction ships. With a card and keys he stole, he found his way into a ship and turned its systems on. At first, he struggled, getting over himself to do something so reckless. He input the well-known code for the New Babylon's gate, and of course a silent mode was turned on. With the ships auto-pilot, the whole craft had slowly ascended up, before speeding right into the depths of space.
