"Ferd, been a long while eh?"

The interior of the Disobedient ship rumbled as they flew through the stars. Ferd was unresponsive.

"Fine, I get it..." Isaac grumbled away as he went back to cleaning his rocket launcher.

The crew acted like nothing had changed ever. They played harmonicas, chatter and music filled the seats. New faces appeared as well, likely belonging to the higher Disobedient ranks who have turned against order. Ally played with her fingers, sitting right next to Ferd, both sharing a dull lifeless face. Vlad thought to talk, but restrained himself, he doesn't mean to make things worse. After the death of Lips, Vlad has been promoted to the camp leader, with no missions or crazy orders on record so far. He doesn't plan on doing those anyway, pure anarchy was set since then.

"Listen up." He raised his voice, silencing the music. "We are about to land. In case any of you have forgotten, we will be deploying on the monochrome planet of 'Gen-72'. The whole army will be split into six, surrounding the center of the conflict. Each chain will hold Ants, equipped with special anti-matter cannons to deal with the inexplicable. The world is once more infested with Citadelarians, unclear to which tier. We will finally put an end to the 'Genkatan', for good, for our freedom."

"For Lips!" One fellow from the crowd yelled out, raising their fist in the air. The whole interior soon burst into raw emotion, a will to put an end to terror. Everyone put on vests, equipment, loaded their weapons with ammo. Belts, helmets, goggles, stricken with deep red. 

The lightning storms crackled with crashing impacts, the small Disobedient ships burst into the atmosphere in a swarm. In this world not even gray existed. All was black, only highlighted with bright white edges. The colossal Genkatan was nowhere to be found, the alarms sound and heavy ordinance was immediately fired to rid the Disobedient army for good. The Citadelarian towers and forces were all surrounding a massive glowing crater for reasons unknown.

Meanwhile at the Babylon, "Is Houston coming by?" where all was at peace, multiple screens obscured a wall at the front of a couch where the whole main crew was sat to witness the prophecy's grand finale.

"Not counting on it." Rose shook his head, eagerly watching the stream.

"What a bummer." Bill crossed their arms.

"So what's all this about again?" Ferdinand spoke up, busy crunching on nachos covered with melted orange cheese.

Everyone around exclaimed in a synchronized simple "Oh my GOD."

Back on Gen-72, most Disobedient ships have managed to land at the easily conquered safe spots further away. Fellows from all sorts of other scrap camps rushed to build cannons, artillery, as they all awaited for dropships to come by and deploy the Big Ants for each chain. The total black darkness was soon turned into stellar chaos of exchanging fire. Traces of bullets, either laser or lead, disturbed the peace with crashing flickering light. Important radio communications were constantly held in place, all the fellows constantly yelled into their devices to keep up with each other. With something heavy suddenly dropped behind them, with a force so powerful that everything jumped for a split-second, the dropships finally came and the dozens of Big Ants arrived for each chain - more than expected.

"What's the point of sending in the Genkatan? Thought it was just to get the prophecy going, you don't mean to actually use it for warfare right?" Bill asked, calmly.

"Oh, yeah, for sure." Rose could not hide his excitement.

Houston opened the doors from behind the couch and walked in, glanced at the stream, and took Ferdinand's whole plate of nachos before walking away again.

Back on the battlefield, everyone was still in rush. All the chains were slowly but successfully closing in on the Citadel forces. The jets flew by with ear-screeching noise, swiftly bombing sides depending on who they belonged to. The traces left by all the weaponry lit the sky, including all the machinery. The towers lit their spotlights to track Disobedient jets... A massive beam of light punctured through the sky, and with a roar the Genkatan rose up at the center of the crater with a roar.

"What even is her mission here?" Bill was confused.

"I told her to just play around, do Genkatan things." Rose shrugged, "Well deserved break, of course until the Queen comes."

"You let that nuclear bomb just walk around?!"

Whilst all the warfare was happening, Ferd and Ally were sat on the ship's rear, observing all the chaos unfold. Unenthusiastic, uninterested, they watched each side brawl until nothing would remain. The Queen, to everyone's surprise was nowhere to be seen. Ferd's communicator device rang out with an order, to find a way to destroy the Genkatan with his gauntlet. The Big Ant's cannons weren't doing much, from all around each side the shells flew and hit with no effect. The Genkatan was furious, spending its time charging its right abnormal arm swung its fist and created a white nuclear blast which erased an entire Disobedient chain in a second. All communications went offline, nothing remained.

"Better get moving." Ferd murmured, tiredly.

"Do you have a plan?" Ally tilted her head, lacking the energy just like Ferd.

"Well..." He scratched his chin, "I can't think of a good way to do this, I just want to sneak in there and punch it... We've been through this before."

"I don't know how I'll get back to my abnormal state." Ally looked back at the war, "I just feel like..."

Ferd extended his right arm, putting his gauntlet at the front of Ally, "Could you somehow melt into the gauntlet? We'll share the same body, not sure if I told you about it before. I still can't get a good use out of this golden trash any other way."

The Disobedient tanks on the battlefield rolled, along with troops running at their sides. At the terror of everyone's eyes, the giant Citadelarian walkers have rose from the ground fashionably late. They dug up from the ground in hundreds, and without hesitation all the Big Ants were ordered to fire at the walkers. Their light cannons proving more effective than on the Genkatan, this sudden shift of weaponry changed the tide of battle for the worse. Unexpectedly, the Genkatan picked one of the Citadelarian walkers with its fingers, and curiously observed it with its six eyes before dropping it back on the ground.
Ferd blitzed through the army, his gauntlet now fully black covered by tendrils, and two eyes sticking out of course. Their body was significantly enhanced, changed, Ferd could exploit strength and speed whilst Ally could control his right arm and create anything to aid their path. Often times Ally's black arm would force its way out of Ferd's back to cover him from any injury, perfect symbiosis. Leaping through the walkers, shredding through vehicles, avoiding as much conflict as possible, they ran to the towering Genkatan. It was busy charging its arm again to unleash yet another powerful strike, forcing Ferd to pick up more speed before it was too late. Their unusual strategy was soon put to a halt, the Genkatan swiftly turned to them. With a more simpler, controlled blast from the palm of its hand, they were directly hit by an unstoppable white beam of light. 

"FERD!!!" Ally's voice yelled out in his mind, drowning in the light he ensured the gauntlet was in his shadow.

"I'll live this." He slowly walked, as if he went against a furious blind wind. His fur burned, extending his left arm out to cover his eyes from the blinding light.

"I'll cover you! What are you doing?!" She continued to speak in his mind, "Let me!-"

Ferd's skin melted, his body was giving away, until Ally forced his right arm to his front. Now he was in her shadow, burning and melting. Ferd struggled to move the gauntlet back, or to proceed forward, taking little steps back. Ally created a black umbrella shape at the front of the gauntlet to cast a greater shadow, though it burned fast. She tried to not express her pain, before it got much worse Ferd forced his gauntlet back again.

"Don't do that!!!" Ferd yelled out, all the memories of black matter interacting with his gauntlet came in a flash. 

There was no way out of this light, the Genkatan would stand and keep the beam flowing until they perished, erased from the universe.

He felt the senses of touch, a nostalgic smell in the air. He thought of a figure, his mother. Writing stories, studying, doing her job. With long gray hair, a striking ponytail anyone could recognize. All the summers they spent together, all the vacations, all the frustration from homework when he was just a kid, not worrying about anything. No prophecy, no conflicts, no breakups...

In a move no one could predict, his left hand suddenly morphed into a black claw. Absorbing all the light from the beam into the hole at the palm of his hand, in a quiet moment all that energy was transferred back at the Genkatan, dealing a devastating critical strike to its chest with a delayed boom. Ferd was quiet, taking a moment to look around, sliding their deformed glasses onto their eyes while tying their hair. Their body smoked, but healed surprisingly quickly.

"I always thought that was a sick move, wanted to try it out for myself."

Ally's two eyes popped out of his gauntlet, "...W-what?"

"Oh... you must be his new girl, darling. Becoming one is such an intimate act, it's been too long."

"What are you?!" Ally could not understand those words coming from Ferd's mouth.

They finished tying their hair, "Oh, I'm a lot to unpack..."

"...call me Rila."
