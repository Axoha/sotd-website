The following morning was busy. Right after breakfast everyone was sent for mandatory exercise before the Disobedient ships would come to pick them all up. Another briefing occurred within the ship.

"Amornia, love city, a place divided in two by class." Lips stood firmly and spoke, holding a stick to navigate the crews' eyes as she pointed at various notes on the board. "Wildly popular, favorite tourist attraction, supposed torture for common residents."

"Ain't the whole city belong under the Citadel's umbrella?" A fellow from the last row asked, raising their hand.

"Yes, that brings us over to the next point." She clicked on a remote to proceed into next slides, "The Citadel. No destruction allowed, no slaughter either, we must be fully undercover for the coming operation. Intel and predictions by the best researchers around suggest the Queen will land here within two hours to turn the region monochrome. Everyone will be split into groups of five and scattered across the city, holding the best positions available until her arrival..."

Ferd looked over to Houston who was giddy, smiling, shaking. He was concerned but didn't say anything.

"...Not to mention, *NO MORE TRUCES!* Do not interact with anyone, and in case of being attacked you have the full right to defend yourself! Leave no witnesses behind..." She slowly walked around with her hands behind, speaking in a monotone strong voice. 

"Houston, you okay?" Ally asked, twice as more concerned than Ferd.

"Yea, there's just... SOMETHING! I'm excited!" The grip on their own thighs grew firmer, "They-" With no time to speak, the whole camp began dividing into groups. Ferd, Ally, Houston, Vladimir, and Isaac would all be tasked for their own mission as everyone else. The ships sank down to the rooftops of the bustling neon city, stealthily firing tow hooks to form ziplines for each group to reach their positions. There was no safety, Houston went first without worry, Vlad went second holding Isaac in his arm, and then Ferd had to carry Ally on his back due to her fear of heights. Once they all landed on the rooftop, they waved goodbye and wished luck for everyone still aboard the ship. It was night, the world below them was polluted with neon pink lights, the stars were invisible in the sky. Advertisements, gigantic skyscrapers, and of course a Citadelarian tower all loomed around. 

"Aight, niche facts from me, part two." Houston confidently spoke up, "Lately, there's been an urban legend going on about vampires haunting this city. By each day more and more people decide to join a certain club which doesn't have a name, but they all share the common goal of eradicating the so-called vampires! I don't know why people would join after there's been no proof or evidence..."

"Where are you leading with this?" Ferd was confused.

"I say, we blend in, there's a lot of freaks around this city and the best way to earn respect is by-"

"Buying clothes?" Ally raised an eyebrow, "Sure, why not." She said with a smile. Vlad had no reaction whatsoever.

They extended a thick cable down to lower floors, slowly making their way to the dark empty alleyways next to the crowded streets. They chattered about whatever in the meantime, it was a lengthy process. They couldn't reveal themselves out to the public, not in such militaristic attire. Houston dropped down onto the lowest rooftop, brought a small satellite router out of their bag and stood it on the gravel for it to sneakily connect to the worldwide internet. Then they pulled out their phone and looked up the top ten best clothing stores nearby (that are currently closed). A little more nudging around, climbing through vents, and they barged into an empty mall.

"Oh my god, oh my god." Houston was visibly freaking out, fumbling their hands getting a flashlight from their bag, "Everything is in stock!!!"

"I fully expected you to like, actually go to a store and buy clothes for us." Ally rolled her eyes, "You've been surprising me every time!"

"Why is it closed? Isn't this a perfect time to have a store open with how many people are out there?" Ferd scratched his head.

"Ferd, this city is massive." They looked back at him, "People have lives, not everything is automated by robots here surprisingly."

"I forgot that's even a thing..." He looked down, "Machinery all around, not something I'm too familiar with."

"Okay, I need you all to stay here." They went back to looking at clothes, "Ally."

She replied with a simple "Hm?" before her hand was grabbed and dragged into a changing room by Houston. They nabbed a bunch of clothes, accessories, perfumes, make-up, threw what was needed over to the sheathed changing room. Ally, overwhelmed, stepped out of the curtains dressed in a pretty hardcore gothic outfit. A black skirt, fishnets, reflective shiny boots... Houston wasn't done yet, they forced her hands up so they can dress her in a cheap metal band shirt and a black leather jacket. Black arm warmers, bracelets, a necklace, then they made her look to them so they can get started on the makeup. A perfect black mean eyeliner, a little gray on the white cheeks, some white to cover the unnoticed dirt, then they sprayed her with a pleasant perfume. All of this took five minutes, the rest watched with amusement.

"Now, look in the mirror." Houston was proud of themselves.

Ally was dizzy flinching at the sight of her new self. So clean, so fresh, so stylish! She faintly touched her cheek as Houston added in a little black flower on her head as a final touch. She shivered, with more thought she decided to tear apart her shirt and jacket to go back to her usual bare top covered only by a bandaged binder.

"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!" Houston was completely devastated, "The whole fit was carried by the top! You kinda look like a bogus now... Whyyyyyy?!"

She continued looking at the mirror, stunned, "I really like this, I feel fake but... I feel lovely." She posed, examining her accessories, "I don't like having my body covered with shirts and things, sorry!" She finally replied with a flattered tone.

"It's okay..." They looked down in defeat, "Anyone else?"

Vlad backed away with Isaac on his shoulder, but Ferd willingly chose to be next. Houston came abound with their previous methods, they fit him with a fancy black leather trench coat and boots, and slid his glasses down from the forehead onto his eyes. He looked at the mirror, fascinated, he thought of a time Ena used to do this to him as well.

"You are not getting me into that extreme gothic style, it is not for me." Vlad crossed his arms and shook his head, rejecting Houston's request for the second time.

"PLEASE?" They were desperate, "I can make you look like an average American biker, I think that would be perfect for you!"

He scratched his chin, "Okay, sure."

Ferd and Ally hung out outside, chatting about something private as they waited for the others to get ready. They finally crawled out of the vents, and to their surprise, Vlad looked no different other than having a leather jacket and a bandana over his hat. Houston on the other hand looked absolutely gorgeous, their hair long and fluffy, no wonder it took them so long. Isaac annoyingly urged them to get a move on, a supposed friend of theirs they were meant to meet up with has already arrived at their destination, waiting. They went from rooftop to rooftop, until they reached a safe and sneaky way to descend down onto the ground. They walked into the moving crowd of people, checking out everyone around. Diversity was welcome, everyone was free to dress how they wished. Vlad walked at the front, Isaac sat on his shoulder guiding the whole team.

"Um, Houston." Ally tapped on their shoulder, "You mentioned us dressing as some sort of vampire hunters, right?"

"Did I?" They silently mumbled, "Oh right, yeah, what about it?"

"I wanted to say you made me look like a vampire! My bleak skin doesn't help!" She complained, "And even Ferd, he's giving off-"

"No, I think he's got the memo right the most. Look at his hat! Wide brimmed, the typical of what you'd see from a vampire hunter." They crossed their arms.

"Wait, when do I have this on me-"

"You just took someone's hat and put it on him." She was not amused.

"I ain't think it matters." They turned their head back to the direction they were heading.

They found their way to the destination. A club, with booming muffled music coming from the inside. The entrance was a tunnel with stairs leading into the underground guarded by a single person holding a list of names. The team thought about it, wondering if they had their names on the list, they proceeded anyways. Houston pushed their way forward, about to speak for everyone and pretend they're someone else with fake identities.

"Isaac? Vladimir?" The guard immediately questioned with a raised eyebrow, completely ignoring Houston at the front, "Your arrival was awaited, come forth."

And so they did, but the rest were blocked by them... until Vlad reached out his hand to grab all three of them with him.

The inside was bustling full of flashing lights. Intense rave music played out as the people danced on the sparkling dance floor. The energy was unmatched. Most folks around had a thing for cyber-modifications, prosthetic arms, legs, eyes. All of them stuck closely together as they moved through the crowd, everyone was just a black silhouette around often lit by a spotlight. Like a magnet, one person immediately attached themselves to Ferd.

"Oh what's this, darlin'?" They handled and brushed over his gauntlet, "Do you come from the Babylon, perchance? Wanna dance?"

"Uh, no, I'm busy..." He felt his heartbeat fasten, "I got to go somewhere, sorry."

"Aw, isn't that a shame?" They looked down, right before they grabbed Ferd's arm and dragged him onto the dance floor, "This ain't no place for being busy, darlin'."

Ally, furious, pushed them away and grabbed Ferd's arm to drag him back. They swiftly reunited to navigate through the thick crowd until they found a bead curtain into the backrooms. The hallways were empty, long, and dark, with just a single red dot in the distance. Isaac knew how to navigate, three doors right, turn left, second door to the right. Isaac without hesitation opened the door to what seemed to be a repurposed hospital room...
A body laid on a steel bed frame, and a rich chair that was facing away turned to the team. Wall was formally sat, with a wielder's mask on their head.
