In this world, during this constant war, nobody can truly die.

A few days earlier...

"Doc." Bill mustered up the strength to speak, embedded in a cold hospital bed, "How much longer."

Rose walked around, gathering various equipment and medicine, "Not long. You'll be back on your feet in no time!"

"You always say that..." He rubbed his mouth, drooling from all the medicine. Under his gown was a prosthetic made of steel, embedded and wrapped around his waist. The room was dark. "Play some of my favorite music, the classic ones, you know."

"Sure, king." Rose smirked, "It was not easy coming up with such prosthetic, not even mentioning the whole procedure to even get you fully working."

5th Symphony in C Minor - Ludwig Van Beethoven, the speaker sound with this specific track.

"Thanks." Bill went back to looking at the ceiling, "Tell me what's new, what to expect." His voice seemed dead.

"Quite a lot of development occurred, actually." He raised a finger, "I have been watching that final camera recording of Ferd, within the metro, jotting down every detail..."

"...And?" He raised an eyebrow.

"Things don't match up, the gauntlet is stranger than we think." He reached out to his terminal, conveniently placed in Bill's personal hospital room. Rummaging through the various tightly organized files whilst checking his personal written notes, he found and played the camera footage on a big screen.

"Don't play that." Bill looked away in embarrassment, "Don't make me relive through such a stolen victory."

"Fine, I'll only play the audio." He scoffed, pausing the current music.

Through gargled fast-forwarded sounds, the muffled quote from Ferd during the final encounter played out, "The decades of military training really paid off."

"Decades." Rose looked back at Bill, "This man has been in military service - for only SEVEN YEARS!"

"He could've just been getting cocky." He rolled his eyes.

"Have you not noticed the whole personality shift?!" He tried talking sense to Bill, "The gauntlet was in full effect, granting him some sort of skill to swiftly evade and overpower you! You had him pinned! You are physically dozens of times stronger than him!"

"That's what we always assumed the gauntlet would do." He was confused at his rash expression.

"Yes, but we are talking about possible..." He raised a finger again, his voice drifting, "Who knows what he- or whoever may be up to, in total control of the gauntlet."

"Could it be them?" Bill scratched his head, thinking, "I think you're kinda just overreacting."

"That is what I am worried about." He looked down, sighing in worry, "If they're let loose, the end of existence may be coming faster than expected."

"Yeah, totes overreacting." He scoffed and went back to laying on the bed, staring at the ceiling.

Back to the present day, within the monochrome region of Zuma II.

"Remember your mission, retrieve him, don't die." Rose spoke through Bill's headphones, he only stared at Ferd who was struggling to stand up in the blood-stained snow.

"Doc, he's down after a single punch." He rolled his eyes, "Get the extraction ready-"

He was thwacked by scrap debris which Ferd managed to snag as he wasn't paying attention. Effectively, it distorted Bill quite a bit.

"Playing games, again." He shook his head. He dashed and threw a blow, Ferd managing to evade by luck. Another one on one fight ensued between them, Rose watching carefully through the various cameras around.
The raven extended its wings, throwing off Houston and Ally as it rose up into the clouds. They frantically looked around for any other options, assisting Ferd was no option as the special ops of the New Babylon were everywhere. Once the raven left the area, a fog set back in with fierce winds. 

Ally nudged at their head, their shoulders, "Houston, Houston, you don't have to carry me, I'm feeling fine."

"No you ain't! You were just shot with a special bullet designed to immobilize your whole body for an hour!" They spoke through gritted teeth, trying to hide from the special forces in the snow.

Scoffing, she simply just let go and rolled next to him, "More like a whole minute."

Houston was baffled, they looked and slightly raised her pants to expose her shin. Where the wound should've been, it was gone.

"Damn, what's gotten into you?" She was confused, "Like a whole day earlier you refused to come in any sort of contact now you're covered with me."

"I can't let any of you get in the hands of the Babylon." They looked down, speaking in a serious tone, "No one, not even you."

Ally's expression shifted from a fun one to a more serious face, this wasn't gonna be an ordinary encounter.

Bill continued to throw punches against Ferd, all aggressive and offensive whilst he was all afraid and defensive. No matter what he tried, he couldn't get past his gauntlet. Even with his bio-mechanical hands which could move at extraordinary speeds, all he could leave were dents and the menacing sounds of an echoing metal banging behind. The gravity as usual shift with no warning, turning up so high that both of them are suddenly dropped on the floor, right next to each other.

"Doc, what's going on?!" Bill managed to beep into his receiver.

"Gravity, boss." Rose's muffled voice came from the headphones, "This region changes its gravity at intervals, either one or three minutes average. We've been over this."

He groaned in frustration, a timer suddenly appearing on his watch beeping inform of possible shifts.

"What's up with the violence." With a jaded tone, Ferd surprisingly began to talk, "What's up with all of this?"

Bill was confused, baffled, "You're a criminal!" He yelled out, "You stole the most important artifact from us! And you're asking WHY we're after you?!"

"Oh, right." He rubbed his face, "This gauntlet is a curse. I'd gladly give it back, I hate it."

Bill's aggression turned into confusion, "Then why'd you just... steal it?!"

"I have a girl who has apparently turned into a world-ending threat. Houston told me onto it like 'this thing could potentially save her!' and I was like 'hell yeah!' and I stole it and all that happened. Now it's stuck to me and all I can do is just wait for her to come by and do something, I GUESS."

"Doc, any idea why Houst did that?" He triggered his receiver to ask, Rose only audibly shrugged, "Wonderful."

"In all honesty I have no idea what I'm being led to, I'm just following any options to find my girl again." His eyes darted down, "Now a monster who has struck countless planets and moons. I have read and seen all the news reports, I have thought about her and our possible next encounter, I reminisced of her last words, I just miss her. I only want to be a manic soldier again, completing tough missions with her as usual while we build a new cozy life."

"Doc, he's strangely human." He informed with a concerned tone, "I told you not to bring in the top-rated mercenaries."

"Who the hell is doc?!" 

Ally and Houston navigated through the tracks in the snow, crawling until they reached the remaining wreck of the Big Ant. They hid inside, huddling for warmth. Immobilized bodies of their fellows were everywhere, not retrieved.

"I have a risky plan." They began, "We need Ferd's input."

"Sure, spill it." She rubbed and breathed on her hands for warmth.

"Ferd obviously can't control the gauntlet, but it's capable of breaking the fabric of what we see if it hits something hard enough." They fidgeted their fingers, "I don't know the specifics, but it's the only way out, to dive into the unknown."

"The unknown- fabric of what we see- the gauntlet being controlled? What are you on about?!" She was confused.

"Right, you don't know." They shook their head, "The gauntlet is a divine weapon, capable of creating anything you imagine. The unknown is a deeper layer of life, you have been there with Ferd before."

"How do you know that?" She felt completely weirded out.

"I was only a measly technician at the Babylon, after all." They smirked.

The gravity shift back to low. 

"Ferd." Bill hardly stood up, "I don't even want to fight you after all that you said, man."

He didn't really have anything to say to that. He looked at his gauntlet, then at Bill, then around feeling conflicted. The whole Disobedient crew was incapacitated.

"If all you said is true, come with me." Bill reached out his hand as an extraction ship descended from the thick clouds above.

"I was hoping you'd bring this guy back unconscious! What in tarnation was that whole exchange?! Where's the divine power?! Where's the intense battle we hired so many mercenaries for?!" Rose yelled out from the ship, bewildered.

Ferd was silent, he proceeded into the ship as Bill talked about more nothings to his crew. He felt guilty leaving behind everyone, but he was willing to do anything that helped him progress in his search.

"They got him." Houston gasped. 

They ran with Ally, grabbing a grappling hook and pairs of special boots to put on. The ship had already sailed, but in the nick of time they managed to fire the hook to perfectly entangle one of the tails. They soared high up in the sky along the ship, their hands duct-taped to the equipment. Ally felt pain, having one of her hands to be sealed with Houston's, but it was working. Once the ship reached the stratosphere the ship slowed down enough for them to begin their proper ascension. The boots allowed them both to jump on thin air, enabling them to reach Ferd before the ship would enter space. Ally was inexperienced, struggling, dragging down Houston.

"Ally." They turned their head to her, "You know that one stupid game you showed me a while ago?!"

"What about it???" She yelled back.

"Well this is exactly like it! Imagine you're leaping off some dumb coins or something, you got this!" They encouraged her, which surprisingly managed to raised her confidence. She closed her eyes, and before they both knew it she swiftly climbed her way to the top.

"This may take longer, christ, I forgot to bring masks." They mumbled to themselves, "You're doing great, keep going champ!"

Meanwhile at the interior of the ship, Bill was sat across Ferd. Both of them didn't have much to say, but Rose was fascinated by the gauntlet. Eyeing all the possible marks, damage, effect, he brought out his notebook and began to jot down any detail invisible to the average eye. Ferd was focused on himself, until he overheard something about the pilots mentioning a heartbeat signal.

"Stop the ship, go back immediately." He muttered, "Return now."

Bill and Rose raised their eyebrows, "Huh?"

Ally managed to climb up to the doors of the ship. With a fist, and the only free hand out of the duo, she shattered the glass and got ahold of the interior. Ferd's fur instantly stood up, a shooting star appeared in the skies. All the lights, all the devices, immediately silenced. The queen was conjured from the sky full of stars, and with a dive she pierced directly through the ship into the ground, shattering the monochrome region into fragments of glass. 

Everything went dark and silent.
