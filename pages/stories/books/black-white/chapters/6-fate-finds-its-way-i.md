Snoozing through the whole journey through space, the ships autopilot carried him on its back. Far from their home, in separate galaxy, stood the most glorious civilization of all. The New Babylon's barrier glistened with its gold, being a rich and welcoming society. The ship was suddenly stopped by a system.

"Your passport, please."

A voice came from the ships' screen, it was an automatic transmission. He, however, was still sleeping.

"Your passport, *please.*"

At the long barrier which separated the empty space and the edge of the New Babylon, a digital yellow smiley face persisted and kept asking.

"Sleeper, detected. Performing, *personal scan.*"

With that said, a few light rays traced an outline of his facial features and glasses.

"*Returning* citizen, welcome. You may pass."

The transmission was closed, the gates have opened, the ship continued its stroll. Ferd finally began to wake, his eyes sticky. With a short jump from the barrier to the solar system where the capital was located, he was immediately met with the sacred place.
The New Babylon shined in all its glory. Their exotic planet, referred to as the "Second Earth", looked like as if its surface was golden with a hint of lush green. The ship's autopilot headed straight for the crescent moon that orbit the earth; which in fact wasn't even a moon, but a massive interstellar space station designed for docking ships. Ferd was glued to the cockpit windows, he couldn't believe his eyes at how grand this place is. No wonder any vacation here cost a fortune.
The ship landed on a clean slate. The doors opened and Ferd struggled to walk out after all that space travel, including constantly laying around. The ship itself was very dirty, the difference between his home and this place was very clear, dozens of classes away from each other. After he walked away from the slate, an automatic system grabbed the ship and docked it somewhere safe. Loud mechanical noises came from around everywhere, paired with an announcer constantly speaking which echoed across the whole space. People around were rich, dressed in stylish clothes, compared to Ferd who had a torn jacket with the most basic ragged clothes on. Some people left odd stares, but he didn't seem to mind much. He walked by a large window which had a perfect view of the Second Earth... He turned his head and stared at it, a once in a lifetime sight for a pebble like him.

"Hey." Someone unknown spoke up to him.

"Huh?" He turned back, looking at a supposedly wealthy dude.

He brought out his wallet, took a coin out, and tossed it over to him using a flipping technique. Ferd clumsily caught the coin, and suddenly the man was walking away. He was estranged, he wasn't homeless, all this class difference was really getting to him.
Another challenge took up to him, he walked and stopped at the center of an open area. He didn't know where to go. Following basic logic, he would take a ride over to the capital, though there were multiple central capitals! He thought, looked at the population count of each city, asked around but got little to not response, then it finally struck him. Of course, the secret project, of course, the grand museum. He himself didn't really understand why he would need to go there, but, he is willing to follow any order to find Ena.
Saint Kalina, one of the seven core capitals of the second earth. He managed to get on a ride, a shuttle that was also dubbed an 'interstellar bus'. From the space station all the way to the city, he sat down in a surprisingly not-crowded bus. He rummaged through his bag looking for something to eat, and while he was doing so a Citadelarian peacefully walked by and sat right next to him. Ferd slowly turned to his left and looked down with a weird stare.

"Hi!" They spoke through their communicator organ and waved.

He, on the other hand, couldn't get himself to say anything, awkwardly looking back to the window. Upon landing, Ferd stepped outside to squinting his eyes. Everything shined, including the floor. Golden skyscrapers were everywhere, the sun was strong, and the sounds of fountains and rustling urban trees made for an otherworldly sight for him. There were fruits growing all around for anyone to come and pick, the crowds were diverse and uplifted, many workers worked their jobs; it was a paradise, a heaven. Ferd didn't waste any time frolicking around though, he went straight for the museum. Despite how tempting everything around him looked like, he needed to know what was going on. He thought many things as he walked along the way, he was keeping close track of the direction he was-

Without paying any attention to his close surroundings, he slammed right into a stranger. All their papers and notes they were holding went flying into the street.

"EY?!" They yelled out, "The actual hell was that?!- Oh my god..."

"Look I'm so so sorry..." Ferd frantically spoke as he collected some of their pages, "I wasn't paying any attention and I-"

"Nah, nah, it's fine champ." In a sudden change, they didn't seem to be aggravated anymore.

"Um?" He was confused, "Excuse me?" He asked as he handed over most of their documents.

"Ferd Ray, amirite?" They placed their hands on the hips, "White, black marks, glasses, ragged clothes..."

"Uh???" He was even more confused, "How do you- Who are you!?"

"Call me Houston, champ." They proudly place a fist on their chest, "You're really a big deal out there, you know? There isn't a single week where I don't hear a thing about you." They happily offer their hand for a handshake.

"Am I really that popular..?" Ferd thought and looked down blushing, "Uh, sure, nice to meet you Houston!"

"Your... Disobedient antics are really a show, can't lie." They shook his hand, "You must be starving, man, I gotta take care of you here. Come with me."

And so, he obeyed. He followed the white rabbit, a person with long hair and a stylish black leather jacket.

"A clothing store..?" Ferd raised an eyebrow, "What for?"

"Look, you can't be out here wearin' all that. We need to fix you up, or else you'll be left outside  like a wet dog." They shook their head, with their hands on the hips.

"I suppose so..." He scratched his chin while looking at the name of the store, 'Drip & Drown'.

Houston walked into the store with Ferd following closely behind. They urged him to scrape his boots at the door scraper right at the entrance, it took a while. The inside of the store was very stylish, abstract music played in the background as his own boots squeaked on the floor.

"Here, put this ol' reliable on." They handed him a simple tuxedo suit, "Think something like this fits you the most."

"I do usually feel good in these..." He got a hold of it and glanced at the fabric, and then he saw the price tag.

"Five-thousand six-hundred eurals?" He was bewildered, "How expensive is that here???"

"Oh, very." They giggled, "Everythin' here is a hundred- if not two-hundred times more expensive 'round here."

"And you're just gonna buy that for me?" He tilted his head, squinting his eyes.

"Yah, I got the money, I got my jobs, how do you think I hang 'round here?" They smiled, "Now go change pretty boy I wanna know if I nailed the right size."

He complied, though, he also felt a bit unease. He took a long time changing clothes, and then he finally came out of the changing booth looking fresher than before.

"Awesome step forward." They smiled holding a thumbs up and grinning, "No idea what took you so long but you're lookin' real nice."

Ferd looked over at Houston, who was wearing a dress. "Um, what's the deal with that?" He pointed a finger.

"What?" They looked at themselves, "Can a dude like me not just dress so beautifully? We may even get a discount for such appearances."

"It's like um..." He looked away for a bit, "You... Aren't you a-"

"I ain't believe in that nonsense." They smirked, then looked back at him, "Before you get the wrong idea we're ain't going on a date either so stop blushin'."

"Uh huh." He held a skeptical look, "It'd be nice if you could, you know, tell me the whole deal."

"I am getting you clothes dummy, so they even allow you to enter like all the places around." They looked jaded, "Am assuming you're here for the grand thing that opened days ago, eh?"

"Yeah..." He scratched the back off his head.

"Well that settles todays plan!" They grinned again, "C'mon, you must be starving by this point."

With a simple nod, they proceeded to buy the glamorous clothes that cost probably too much. They walked out and slowly approached the museum, which was unsurprisingly colossal, holding a massive clock that rang the bells every hour. It's style was similar to Greek architecture, oddly enough.

"Yo." Houston spoke up, "Here we are."

"*The Golden Spoon.*.." He recited the name of the restaurant, "Are there really no fast food chains in this city?"

"No." They shook his head, "That ain't exist in this world."

Without much to say, he proceeded into the restaurant, but was stopped by Houston.

"Wait up!" They announced, "I bought something else for you as well!"

And then they sprayed him with perfume, in small amounts.

"...Thanks." After an awkward pause, he gave it his best shot at smiling back.

At the scene of the restaurant, both of them were sat across each other at a table eating the food they ordered. The mumblings of dozens filled the spirit of the room, paired with some somber jazz music in the background. Ferd twirled his fork on the food, not familiar with these types of places. Houston crunched on their salad, looking directly at his eyes.

"Yo." They spoke up, "You know, I wonder what the deal with the blushing was." Smirking, they eat another piece of lettuce.

"What a way to start a conversation." He shook his head as he chewed.

"It's funny! Tell me, my curiosity is killin' me." They lean over the table, tenting their hands and placing their head on it.

"Well, first of, I'm not interested, I can't believe I'm saying that." He continued to eat more, "And... I don't really know how to put it into words, just the way you act... it reminds me of Ena, I'm assuming you know who that is."

"Oh, I know, is that why you've gone all the way over here?" They tilt their head, "Must be a shock, having the love of your life just stripped away out of nowhere."

"Yeah, I suppose that's the whole deal." He ate less and less, only a few pieces of meat were left which he had no appetite for anymore.

"I can relate." They rest their chin on their hand, looking more gloomy, "I used to go out with a guy once, similar to how you look. Years ago we worked together, hung out each evening, and then, just out of nowhere he was gone. I wasn't even there, all I got was a measly death report, and man, I couldn't move for like a week straight." Their speech slowly turned into mumblings.

"I'm so sorry." He put down the fork and knife onto the plate.

"But I got over it." They smiled and rest their head on the chair, "Life turns emptier, but, it doesn't disappear."

"That's nice." He took a napkin to clear out some messes.

"I can help you find her." They locked in eyes with Ferd, "I ain't sure what all I can do, but, I have some connections 'round here regarding the grand opening."

He was pleasantly surprised hearing that.

"I'll tell you more about it on the way." They smirked, "And also you'll lead, the museum's impossible to miss! I ain't wanna drag you everywhere, y'know?"

And he didn't need to hear anything more.
