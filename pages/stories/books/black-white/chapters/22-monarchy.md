Multiple groups from the camp struggled to keep the beast at a single place. Imbued with rope, tow hooks, it couldn't teleport at a wrapped state. The main team rushed towards the street, and there it was. Like a web between buildings, one could wonder just how much rope was used. Ferd began to scale the building, reaching and traversing through the web like an arachnid. The beast, Juno, struggled. It muffled, it shook, it squirmed; he felt pity for the creature, but it must be retrieved. He calls out to Houston to hand him rope, and with tender and slow movements he ties it around the beast...
By unintentionally slightly brushing the beast with his gauntlet, in a second it tore away from all the rope and leapt into the streets. Ferd was yanked from his spot, holding onto the rope for his dear life hanging in the air with all the strength. Houston, Ally, Vlad, and Isaac watched blankly from the asphalt road down below.

"Regroup!" An urgent muffled voice sound from their devices sounding like Lips, "Wait for the ship, building A-21. The Queen is rapidly approaching!" And with that, everyone hurried packing their things scaling the nearby building with ropes and climbing equipment. 

The wind blew fiercely. The beast ran from the sides of the buildings, leaking black fluids from its arms and neck. Ferd climbed the rope he was holding onto, trading his arm. Left hand, right gauntlet, left hand, right gauntlet, left hand, and his device received a call which was picked up automatically.

"Ferd! You doin' fine? Ain't your first time challenging a beast, for sure! Anyway in the coming fifteen minutes-" 

Ferd rammed straight through a thick brick wall, destroying any gadgets he had on him. Broken face, bleeding, missing teeth, a painful experience which was soon regenerated, and then he hit another wall again. His entire body would break and repair as the beast ran among the buildings. He wished to let go of the rope, but it was as if the gauntlet was stuck to it. His yelps in pain, grunts, heavy breaths, would soon meet yet another wall to hit at a dangerous velocity.

"You think he's fine?" Ally talked to Houston, everyone aboard a Disobedient ship.

Only static came through Houston's communication device. They tenderly held it in their hands, "Eh, yeah. He's been through worse."

A dropship suddenly flew by carrying a Big Ant, this time armed with a special cannon never seen before. It was urgently deployed at the Love City's only flat space, the local park with heart shaped ponds. A shooting star appeared at the night sky, and the cannon began calculating and charging the perfect shot. The rest of the camp watched with curiosity, some were betting their currency on whether that shot would take down the queen.

"Yo, fisheye. Ya think the shots gonna kill the queen?" Someone came around, hanging their arm over Ally's shoulder.

"Nope." She shook her head, "A simple cannon won't do, mister."

"Nah." A confident smirk grew on their face, "That ain't no ordinary cannon. Whatever the top engineers were on in the meantime, they managed to construct this beastly weapon using them samples we collected."

"Oh..." She turned her head to the Ant's cannon, "I'm still betting on nope." She gave them a bunch of her own local dollars.

"O' yeah, come to me..." They walked away, counting the money in their hands.

"I'm betting my whole house on the kill!" Someone yelled from the back.

Ally watched without expression, until Houston's long hair began slapping her face from the strong winds. "Stop that." She requested in a serious tone.

"Stop what?" They smiled, "Oh, my hair, sorry about that." Houston brought out a hair band and tied it all into a simple ponytail.

"I'm not sure what would be a good outcome." She spoke, "If the queen dies, Ferd wouldn't handle it well. If the queen lives, we will likely not make it out alive."

The ship was static in the air. Houston sat down next to Ally, hanging their feet above the dazzling neon city below them. "I believe one option is surely better than the other, ain't it?"

"I know, but..." She stammered, "I want Ferd to be fine, that's all."

"I wish him well, too." They looked down below, "...Besides, weren't you afraid of heights?"

"I was." She smiled, "But I got over it, you can guess why!"

"You wouldn't believe it, but that damn crazy plan left a mark on my hand!" They chuckled.

The simple exchange turned into chatter as the star above grew larger. Ferd finally managed to get up to the beast's legs, his hands trembling from all the injury and healing. Without hesitation, he grabbed onto the beast's leg with the gauntlet and an instant burning reaction ensued. It cried out in agony, frantically kicking its legs as they both slammed into the tallest office building in the city. He wasted no time. The beast tried to escape but was wrapped by all the leftover rope Ferd had in hand.

"STOP IT!!!" It yelled, "PLEASE! IT HURTS!!! I WANT TO GO [ Home. ]"

He walked over, glancing over the nasty burn mark left on its leg. "...What even are you?"

"JUNO." She snarled, "JUNO!"

"What are you escaping from?" He began to interrogate.

"THE QUEEN, THE CITADEL! OBVIOUSLY!" She squirmed, struggling to move. Her digital face turned into a warning icon, "Unstable Matter depleted, refuel immediately." As an artificial soulless inner voice broke out.

"And why." He continued to ask.

"THIS PLACE IS MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION! THE CITADEL DISTRIBUTES UNSTABLE MATTER TO LURE THE QUEEN TO CREATE MONOCHROMIC LAIRS. THERE IS NO STOPPING IT." Her kicking and squirming gradually grew weaker.

"But why!" He yelled out.

"[ The Weapon. ]"

The Queen entered the upper atmosphere, the trails like stardust. The Ant's cannon was at its final stages, everyone from the camp watched with anticipation as more Disobedient forces arrived in ships. The cannon fired with a deafeningly loud boom, and a warped ball of light flew with a similar trail to the Queens. Direct hit. Her cries echoed through the sky, her straight trajectory was intercepted. She fell to the side onto the tallest building of the city, and all the forces immediately rushed to the area of impact. The Citadels' towers on the horizon blared with alarms, and soon their forces would be dispatched to investigate. In the form of fighter jets, a few were sent out and with a sonic boom they blitzed through the fresh Disobedient ships. Outmatched by speed, missiles were deployed and multiple of the higher ranks were down immediately. Lips instantly ordered her pilot to lower the ship into the buildings, and so they did with the whole camp. Firing flares, barely missing more of the Citadelarian missiles, a whole dogfight ensued in the sky. Once the camps' ship was near the targeted building, Lips ordered for everyone but the group for long ranges to go. That ship then ascended into space among many others, where the Citadelarian fighters jets couldn't do anything.

Ferd saw it all, he rushed away from Juno's body onto a flight of stairs to reach the higher floors. Juno was left behind, crawling, she took a look at the city through the shattered glass with a smile. Ferd found the Queen, the walls and floors around melted until impact. She was all burnt up, crying, unmoving in a mind numbingly bright room. He immediately walked over to her.

"Ena, Ena, it's me!" He spoke with urgency, "I'm here! Please, grab onto me."

A trembling limb shook its way onto his shoulder, but upon contact it burned her.

"Wait here." He rushed over to a wall to tear off broken rebar, "Hold onto this. I'll get you somewhere dark."

And she did, wrapping her limbs around the metal. He ran off holding the rebar as she slid on the floor, finding an empty meeting room with no windows. With a slam using the gauntlet, he tore off an electrical grid from the wall and everything instantly went dark. He dropped the rebar and collapsed on the floor, leaning against the wall to catch his breath.

...

*Honey...*

His ears perked up, and before him was a shining white point of light which could be no other than the Queen's eye.

*Thank you.*
*But, I am sorry.*
*I knew of everything before, and I tried my best to not let it happen.* 
*I failed...*
*Instead everything is beginning early. I was oblivious until the odd dream, where I learned of my future and the past. You were there with me, but it was not you, it was your heart...*
*I am so sorry. I thought, maybe...*

"Shh, it's okay." He stood up to wrap his left arm over her invisibly dark neck, purposefully holding the gauntlet far from her, "It's not safe here. Sweetie..." His head was close to her unintelligible face. 

*I can... I can open a gate.*
*To the... Sorry, to the...*

"Target set." A sniper rifle-

*I have Hꗇꕒ ꗍꖦꗞꖹꗱꖾ ꗞꘘ ꖡꖾꕯꕷ !!!*

With a powerful shriek, a limb from her body pierced the walls of the room directly to the sniper's location. They were struck, unable to move. Ferd got up instantly and ran off to their location following the Queen's signs. 

"DOC, REQUIRING ASSISTANCE IMMEDIATELY!" A masked agent dressed fully in a black tactical suit tore off the dark limb holding them in place. They clumsily grabbed the sniper rifle and ran off into the dizzily bright hallways, up until Ferd caught up leaping at them to grab their leg.

"Not so fast..!" He spoke through gritted teeth. He swiftly raised his gauntlet until he was kicked in the face by their other leg. They both stood up, trading punches of all sorts.

"You don't want to do this." They shook their head, their voice muffled through the mask, "You are not the target!"

He pinned them against the wall, dropping the sniper rifle on the wooly floor, "You are NOT getting in our way! I'm not letting her get further away from me anymore! You hear me!?"

They raised their hand into the ceiling, and with an open palm they created a black dagger out of thin air. It caught Ferd off guard, and in that moment they deeply embedded that dagger into his wrist, rendering his right arm useless. Then they made another to stab his chest, and another to stab his right eye. The sniper finally kicked him at the weakest moment, a final blow forcing his body to collapse on the ground. They brushed off their suit, grabbed their sniper, and dashed away.

Ferd laid on the ground, alive, but hopeless. Those wounds, those daggers, made of a special matter that stung like an infection. The lights slowly turned off around him, and the Queen made her return in total darkness.
 
*Ferd.*
*Hold onto me.*
*Those wounds don't hurt me, I can assimilate into your body.*

He listened, reaching out his left arm towards her eye. His fingers, later palm, then the arm, and soon his body were wrapped by black tendrils. He could feel his body stand up on its own, and now he felt painless and whole. The Queen's skull became only a mask for the King, and the wound on his left eye shimmered with a white point.

*Honey, let's get this bastard together.*

Houston, Ally, and the rest of the camp rushed up the stairs examining each and every floor, no luck. Citadelarian gunships were sent out to hunt this specific group, firing their green lasers into the windows, hovering besides the office building. Only a few were equipped with rocket launchers, Isaac laughed as they took down some only to immediately retreat as dozens more arrived. Ally and most others hid in cubicles, shooting at the ceiling to make a hole big enough as a new way to climb onto the next floor. There were no signs of the queen anywhere, all seemed lost until one of the gunships' engines suddenly blew up, and then another was mysteriously taken down. Ena and Ferd, now merged as the Monarch, leapt from one gunship to another with a shining black gauntlet from which white tendrils tore apart anything nearby. They jumped, glooming wings encompassed their body as they reached their gauntlet out in the air to create a trident thrice the size of their body. They threw and pierced it through a gunship, then they raised their hand in the air again to retrieve it. Ally and Houston rushed to the window, disregarding orders, absolutely mesmerized by the sight.
A glowing bullet grazed their shoulder, and the direction from where it came from was no other than the sniper. They were attached to a zipline at the side of the building, frantically reloading and firing. The Monarch dived and dodged all the bullets with ease as the sniper began to ascend at rapid speeds. Their wings spread out, flying right below the sniper, the force of the air shattering all the windows passing by. The sniper tumbled and rolled over the gravel floor on the rooftop above the worlds' clouds, aiming and firing as fast as they possibly could. The Disobedient camp caught up, arriving at the rooftop in sheer confusion. There they saw it, a divine being hovering in the air, roaring. The Sniper ran out of bullets and threw the rifle away, attempting at an escape. The Monarch retrieved their trident and before they could throw it their head was pierced by another high caliber light bullet. Rose, holding a rifle in their hands, aboard a golden hovering ship finished the job. The Monarch split into two, Ferd and the Queen tumbled over the rooftop. He groaned, he reached out to Ena but she was shot by the sniper again and again. His ears rang from all the shots, he yelled out in pain as he crawled towards, but the Queen raised their hand and with a beam she disappeared.

"..." He looked up to Ally, who came in late, unable to hear anything she's saying.

"...Ferd! Can you hear me?! Please!!!" She pleaded.

He had nothing to say, but nodded in acknowledgment after some time.

In outer space, complete silence. Lips and a few from the camp were safe, leaned against a wall.

"What the hell could possibly be going on down there?" She questioned, assuming from all the urgent signals and alarms from the cockpit.

The rest of the camp only shrugged, she rolled her eyes and proceeded to enter the cockpit.

"Failure in termination of the Queen, it has been an honor serving you." A pilot spoke into a receiver.

Execution.

Lips was furious, without hesitation she brought out her pistol and shot both pilots in the head to hijack the ship and descend down. A notification immediately opened up on a panel, a call was picked up by the system.

"Lucy Herbanov, what in the world are you doing?! Do not disregard your order!" One of the highest ranks rang through the speakers.

"It has and always will be my responsibility to protect and lead the sanctuary." She scoffed, turning off the call. Once another was automatically picked up she just stabbed the advanced screen with her pocket knife.

The camp was holding their ground on the rooftop, surrounded by multiple Disobedient ships simultaneously firing at them with machine guns. Bullets of lead shred through the building, the rooftop would collapse onto the lower floors. Once all seemed lost, missiles were fired one by one to clear the sky. Everyone's devices rang with Lips urging them to regroup at a spot. Her ship rushed down slightly bumping into the building with the doors open, she ran up to the entrance and reached her hand out. 

"Now."

A massive beam of light punctured through the sky, right through the ship, obliterating everything in its path. From the beam rose a giant, a colossus, a shadow. Its hair blistered with lightning strikes, its face opened up with seven white dots, and its black arm charged with absolute power. It looked like a giant Inka, facing down at the rooftop, the face blinking in morse. 

"Stay, do not attack."

The arm of the colossus calmed, and soon Citadelarian ships arrived. 

The camp, utterly decimated, let go of their weaponry and accepted defeat.
