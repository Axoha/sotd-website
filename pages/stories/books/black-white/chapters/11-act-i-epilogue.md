The night was peaceful, the winds were gone, the whole space shined with its natural beauty in the sky. Ally and Ferd laid on top of each other, sleeping even in the terribly cold environment. The guardian manifested from the pit, looking at them both with a curious nature. She dug her nails deep into Ally's skin and dragged her further away through the snow. Ally was wounded in an incredibly dangerous state. The guardian hugged her, pet her, and laid with her as the comets flew. It was likely she wasn't going to make it, the guardian tore her chest to expose her ribcage out to the cold, and she took the failing beating heart into her hands. She'd proceed to melt, morphing what she could, her core especially, into a replacement for her damaged organs. The whole process took hours, but in the end, Ally's wounds were fully healed and the guardian was gone.

"...'ey, hear me, move these two out, *SAFELY*..."

"...stop pissin' me off..."

"...yes, you, big russian man, be *CAREFUL!* I swear, are all the Disobedients like this?!.. "

"...I'll be yer commander for now, deal with it..."

"...without me you would never find them..."

A couple more spaceship whirrs, bunch of turbulence later...

Ferd opens his eyes at a hospital, more specifically the one they had at their own sanctuary. It wasn't the best, but, it helped his allies recover. He slowly turned and looked around the room, and Ally was on another hospital bed next to him, sat solving a rubik's cube. Oddly enough, her skin color was completely pale and white now. An eastern old song played on a dusty radio next  to them.

"Dude, I was wondering when you'd wake up. The sun is already setting, you were snoozing like crazy!" She'd giggle, "Lovely to see you back on board, I asked the medical team if you were dead like two-hundred times."

"How... did we get here." Ferd could barely speak, there were really big dark circles underneath his eyes.

"Right, I don't exactly know either. A good friend of yours, Houston? Apparently found us and called the Disobedients. At least that's what he told me?" She scratched her chin, Ferd couldn't help but notice all her scars.

"Uh... huh..." He slowly nodded, and fell back to the bed. He couldn't move.

"...Dude, if you seriously assign me to that double-decker crack-shack with the girl you are dead! I mean it! I'm not willing to hang around in that barrel!.." A muffled argument could be heard just outside the room between Houston and an unknown commander.

"Hah... This is a nice camp, Ferd. I've already claimed the walker, you coulda told me you had one of my favorite models just standing there!" She calmly smiled after solving the cube.

She looked at him, "...Ferd?"

And he was just looking at the ceiling, emotionless.
