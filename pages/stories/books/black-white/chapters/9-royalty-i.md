"Boop."

"Boop." ...

Ferd slightly opened his eyes, a cold wind slid right through his fur. His clothes were torn, his glasses cracked. He felt someone poking at his nose at unpredictable intervals with a silly voice. He fully opened his eyes, seeing a stranger sitting right besides them, pointing fingers right at his face. They had an awkward stare-off, in complete silence. The stranger, a dirty axolotl with the skin color of punch, slowly tilted her head as he laid. His wounds were tended to, carefully wrapped by bandages.

She coughed into a fist, preparing to say something with a thick masculine accent, "*Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that-*"

"Yeah don't even." He brushed her off with a weak voice, managing to sit upright after waking. He looked around, he was in some sort of wrecked shelter in a cold desolate gray world.

"Who are you?!" She didn't hesitate to ask, "I came here all alone, into a world nobody knows, identify yourself alien!"

"Um..." He thought, her presence somewhat intimidating, "I'm... Ferd, I've been just a soldier for the Disobedient armed forces for the past seven years. I lived a long time with my girl Ena..."

"Let me clear it up." She gestured him to stop, "What the hell is that thing on your right arm?! How did you even get here?!"

He looked down at the gauntlet, "I stole that." He boldly stated, "With a dude named Houston, from the New Babylon..."

He couldn't remember how he got here. All the memories past boarding the train and getting pinned down by Bill were gone.

"I don't know!" He gave up, "I don't even know where I am!!! I don't know what this thing on my arm is! I'm just following bears to find my Ena! Too much has happened, I'm tired!"

"...Following bears to find an Ena..?" She tilted her head after a short silent moment, "Gosh, I've been looking around everywhere for MY Emma!"

"What? Are you on the same boat as me?" He was intrigued.

"Yeah, that's how I got here." She looked down with a frown, "One day, my star, out of nowhere turned into a beast at the middle of the night! I had her in my grips, I chased after her, and I ended up... here."

"A- a beast???" Ferd's eyes widened as he stuttered.

"I don't even know how to explain it." She shook her head, "I woke up at night, and she was just a sharp silhouette against the full moon."

"Um." He was visibly anxious, "Uh..."

"What's your story? Couldn't have ended up here without experiencing something similar." She stretched her arms and yawned.

"She just disappeared the next day..." He looked around aimlessly, "The last time I saw her was at a cliff, she played an unfamiliar song on her guitar, and told me that she'll always be within my shadows..?"

"Yeah can't help with that mystery." She yawned again, "Seems we're both just goners out here."

"How long have you been here?" He asked.

"Like a week, maybe two, I don't keep track of time well here. There is no cycle." She stood up to reach for her bag.

Ferd replied with just a simple 'got it' after, he stood up to look around. They were in a spacious makeshift camp made of debris, there were bags full of tools and such everywhere, and there was a canned food supply, dangerously small.

"Don't peek outside without a weapon." She spoke from the back as she changed clothes, "It's unstable and dangerous out there."

Ferd looked to her direction and was flustered by the sight of her. Changing clothes in the same room, she casually smoked a cigarette as she put on a lousy ragged shirt with a really big bandana. Her chest was wrapped with bandages, stained with small dried blood spots.

"What? Is this not usual? Especially for Disobedients like you?" She noticed his look.

"No! We don't just change in the same room?!" He was bewildered.

She paused and looked at him with a blank stare, "You're missing out." She said with an oddly seductive look after a short silent moment.

After changing she walked over to Ferd with an oversized scarf that she wrapped around his neck and shoulders. She tossed him a gun and a small ammo reserve, a basic assault rifle that was made of scrap. Whistles of the wind were heard just outside the door, intimidatingly loud enough. Ally opened the door to a violent snowstorm.

"Eh, don't mind that, just a slight breeze. You have some thick boots on right?" She put a finger on her chin and asked.

"Climbing boots-"

"I don't even know why I'm asking." She smugly cut him off as she shoved Ferd into the storm.

Ferd took a lot of sweet time to adapt to the environment as Ally pushed through the winds, eventually passing by him. They talked about anything as they both slowly walked through the desolate snowy landscape. It was flat, with thick white fog obscuring all the details far. Massive black spikes, ruined eastern apartments, they all occasionally just showed up from the fog as they traversed. Ally led him to some sort of pit made of bricks and steel, catwalks at each floor clashing against each other, she leapt down onto the top layer of the catwalks, progressively descending into the bottom. There was little to no wind at the pit.

"The hard part of today is over!" She grinned, "It's time for an even harder part!" Her voice echoed.

Ferd finally leapt down to her, icicles have formed around his cheeks. "W-what is this about?" He was shivering from the cold.

"This, is a gate!" She proudly and sarcastically gestured with her hands to show the barricaded gate, "That leads to somewhere I don't know! I've been trying to open it, trying to find the key, trying to get the right code, but no luck! My Emma, she's ran over here before closing this gate."

Ferd observed the strange symbols around the gate as Ally threw some sticks on the floor and lit a campfire to get on her deciphering work. 

"Oh, besides." She spoke, "We have like three hours, strange creatures appear at specific times. They're sharp, deadly, can turn into whatever, I myself don't know much."

Ally input a code into the seven slots that required a symbol. It was wrong, the bricks have shuffled and she noted another wrong combination. The list was already at the thousands.

*ꘘꗞ𐝥 ꖡꖾꗞꕷꗍ Ⱳꖾꗞ Ⱳꗇꖦꕒꗍ𐝥 ꕯꖦꖡꗞ ꖡꖾꕯꕷ ꖹꖦꘘꗞ𐝥ꖡꖹꖦꗇꖡꗍ ꘝꝆꗇꖀꗍ, Ꝇꗇꔇ 𐝥ꗍꕷꘝꗍꖀꖡ ꘘꗞ𐝥 ꖡꖾꗍ ꘝꗇꕷꕷꗍꕒ ꘘꗞ𐝥ꗱꗞꖡꖡꗍꖦ ꕷꗞꖹꝆꕷ ꗞꘘ ꕒꗍꗍꘝ ꕷꘝꗇꖀꗍ*

That was the text which was written above the gate. There were various symbols around, crosses, flowers, and eyes. Everything around the gate was more modern, as if there used to be an expedition organization around to study this unknown door. He thought of the odd moment that occurred when he put on the glasses before Ena disappeared. Through the black lens, the unreadable text turned white amidst the gray world.

"*For those who wander into this unfortunate place, lay respect for the passed forgotten souls of deep space...*" He murmured to himself as he read the translate text.

"What was that?" She turned to him and asked.

"I think I'm getting somewhere." He boldly stated, he walked over to Ally and crouched next to the empty slots, "These glasses translate everything here!"

She snatched the glasses off of him and put them on, "Woah, dude, from where did you get these?!"

"*Please give it back...*" He was not comfortable with someone wearing his glasses.

"Jeez, sure! You better solve everything here though if you're gonna be like that." She returned the glasses with a grumpy face.

Ferd eyed the symbols at the gate thinking of a possible combination for the password. Those symbols were letters, the password was clearly a word. He took a moment before giving it a shot, inputting a word with seven letters, 'iceberg'.

It was wrong, Ally competitively pushed him aside and thought of a better word, 'wacking'.

That was also wrong, they took turns thinking of words. Minutes, hours, passed by. As they got more codes wrong, they slowly overexaggerated their expressions like as if they were going completely insane.

"*JUKEBOX!*"

"PIZZAZZ!!!"

"*BLIZZAR!*"

"WEEZERS!!!!"

"*FUCKING!*"

Right as they were about to input another word, a small black bear appeared between both of them. Its body was completely black, with long white hair and a cute dotted face with a blobby mouth. It held flowers in its hands, carefully inputting a word into the slots, "srewolf." it said, smiling at both of them. The gate has slowly opened, and the bear walked past into the dark stairwell. 

"...Masy?" Ferd asked.

The bear only stopped and looked at him. It shook its head and continued walking down the stairs. Ally didn't waste any more time, she was overjoyed at the gate finally being open. She dragged Ferd into the stairs, into the total and deep darkness. They descended further into the abyss, the darkness beginning to turn so thick that not even any light source could permeate through. The gates slammed shut behind them, and they had no choice but to continue walking down the stairs. Faint whispers started to sound, paired with ominous echoing noises, it was at a point where they couldn't even see the stairs they were on. Ally stopped, she held Ferd's chest to signal him to pause.

"...I'm scared." She was shaking, her voice trembling, "There is nothing, there could be anything, I don't like this, I don't like this."

"Um." Ferd wasn't scared, "We could sit here to regain some sense, I guess. Maybe our eyes will see something after some time, you know they adapt to darkness right?"

"...No actually." She grabbed her right arm as she sat down, "I feel like I'm going to drown here..."

Ferd sat down, "I remember being terrified of the dark when I was little." He spoke after a moment, "I always imagined there'd be something lurking, watching, at some points its gotten so bad I came running over to my mom crying for my dear life!" He chuckled, "After it has happened multiple times, she ended up giving me some sort of small rock necklace. She told me, 'this relic will protect you from anything that hides in the dark'. It really helped me back then, but then older me figured it was just an expensive scam they sell for tourists in popular places!"

"...I guess that is pretty funny." She had her head resting on her knees, "Tell me more about your world, actually, that doesn't sound like a Disobedients experience to me."

Ferd was pleasantly surprised hearing that, "You're one of the wastelanders, right?"

"Yes I am, living free, scavenging for resources, surviving." She mumbled, "I'm not familiar with a wealthier life, I want to hear more."

"Well..." He thought, "I don't even know where to begin, ask me questions!" He said with a positive attitude.

Before, they were just two voices in a void exchanging short sentences. As they continued to converse, their outlines turned barely visible, the edges of the stairs tinted with a faint highlight. Small white fireflies lit up in the far distance, hovering above in small numbers.

"And as I was saying..." He continued, "Oh- I was right? I think I can see better."

"Now that you mention it, yeah..." She still wasn't that confident.

Ferd stood up, "I think I can continue this totally ominous descent, how about you?"

"I don't think so." She shook her head, still terrified of the unknown.

"If you can't move forward..." Ferd lend her a left hand, "I'll help you, whatever there may be, we'll face together."

Ally's eyes were hardly visible, but they glistened with a faint reflection. She grabbed onto his hand, and together they walked down the stairs holding hands. With each step it felt like the world was becoming more visible. Ally was still anxious and worried sick, but she continued to move forward.

"C-Christmas sounds n-nice..." She tried to spark a conversation, "P-people gifting each other things, spending time together... that sounds nice, I-I want to celebrate that."

"Do you have a family? Friends? Loved ones?" He asked, "That's the way to celebrate, unfortunately rarely anyone accepts strangers during holidays, even if it goes against the whole point."

"I used to." She looked down, "We're looking for her."

"I'm just saying. If I return to my Disobedient camp with Ena, maybe both of you could join us? We have big Christmas celebrations, always super fun!" He smiled at her, even if it was barely visible.

"...That sounds great!" She couldn't help but feel excited for that idea, "Though, how would we get our walker there?"

"You have a walker?" He tilted his head.

"A massive one, skyscraper sized. *RSRC-MVR*, I call them Big Jogny!" She smiled.

"Oh, those..." He scratched his head, "Um..."

And before they knew it, they reached the end. The checkered floor and the surrounding area was illuminated by an unknown light.

"Oh my god." She exclaimed, "I did it, I did it!"

She let go of his hand and tackled him with a hug, "Thank you so much." She said, with closed eyes.

Ferd blushed, but awkwardly tightened the hug. "Thank you too, for uh, patching me up and taking care of me back there."

They let go of each other and continued their journey into the abyss.
Flowers bloomed all around, there were massive pillars supporting the entire hollow underground of the ruins. The floor was ashy, there were multiple black bears similar to Masy looking from afar.

"So, about the walke-"

With a sudden loud impact, a moving colossal statue made of marble intercepted their path. Fallen from the ceiling, it stood up, re-arranging all its limbs as it watched over the duo. Its face lit up, six white lights similar to a dice. 

**"ꕷꗞꕷ ꕷꗞꕷ ꕷꗞꕷ ꕷꗞꕷ ꕷꗞꕷ"**
**"ꕯꖦꖡ𐝥ꖹꕒꗍ𐝥ꕷ, ꕯꖦꖡ𐝥ꖹꕒꗍ𐝥ꕷ, ꖀꗇꝆꝆꕯꖦꗱ ꖡꖾꗍ ꗱꖹꗇ𐝥ꕒꕯꗇꖦ."**

It spoke with a booming which echoed throughout the space. It sounded like a device, an ancient machine which blared an alarm of an unknown rhythm. Ferd's gauntlet lit up, and the statue backed away at the sight. The statue's arms suddenly turned black, spikes emerging from its shoulders. Ferd and Ally both had no idea, but they held their ground, they would get rid of this statue no matter...

A black tentacle pierced through the statue's chest, both of its shoulders became wrapped in more tentacles, and something tore off its arms with an agitated force. Its neck and waist also became wrapped and torn apart, the statue crumbled apart in front of their eyes. A black spiky silhouette hovered where the statue once was, the sight of it making the duo dizzy. It opened its two white dotted eyes from the darkness, a jagged mouth, and it screamed.
