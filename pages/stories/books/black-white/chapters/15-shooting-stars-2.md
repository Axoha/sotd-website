The group approached the direction of the received signal, which was confirmed not to be the other group in a series of confused interactions. There was an ominous silence within the walker, no one had anything to say. Suddenly, the wind blew fiercely, followed by a mind-numbing impact.

"*SHIELD INTEGRITY AT*-" And the lights within the walker went out. The receiving signal was gone. The Big Ant attempted to stay on it's fours, but eventually the gravity changed again and it collapsed to its side.

"What the hell was that?! Did anyone even see!?" Ally was absolutely shook, among many others. She quickly got out of the pilots seat and made her way to one of the exits, busting down the door to a violent snowstorm outside. She looked at the main body of the walker, it was clawed, gaping metal wounds in the mark of a scratch. She quickly got back inside for warmth, looking at Ferd and Houston in a question on what next.

"Contact the other group immediately." Ferd spoke in a bold and commanding voice, "Set up a campfire, fix up the Ant to make it mobile again. We'll be here for a while."

"Shouldn't we rather be loading up the main cannon?!" A fellow spoke from the crowd, concerned.

As much as Ferd didn't want to resort to violence so quickly, he gave in easily. "Do that as well, I suppose."

A strong channel was set for communication between the two groups. They were quickly informed and have loaded their cannons, however, they weren't picking up any 'heartbeat' signals. Ferd went through the stash at the back of the Ant to get himself a pair of infrared binoculars, rope,  and a thick coat. Vlad was mostly in charge of the command, people have actually started listening to him after looking back at his successes and the big speech. Ferd looked for more equipment, such as something that could trace signals, but it wasn't anywhere where it should've been.

"You wanna go so bad, into the cold, all alone..." Houston smirked as they leaned against a wall, holding the right device he needed, "I ain't lettin' you, no matter how much you want to."

"Sure, you can come with me." He sighed.

"Rad." They smiled, "Let's go."

Dressed in the thickest coats available, both of them smoothly opened an exit and dropped down onto the ashy snow. The masks they wore hardened communication, but it was manageable. The winds made it hard to move. They both settled not too far after treading the storm, rummaging through their bags for the binoculars they needed. Ferd got ahold of his personal ones and looked through them, the snowstorm making the infrared vision a pain to see through.

"Why not take Ally with us?" He questioned as he rotated, looking for any potential heat source.

"She's busy." They quickly replied, "She's all over walkers, we'll get that thing runnin' in no time with her."

"I suppose..." He said with a somewhat somber tone, "Aren't you the technician of our group, though? Wasn't that your job even before?"

"I'm experienced in everythin'." They shook their head, "Give me any job and I'll do it, easy."

Ferd had no particular response for that. He continued looking, checking if there have been any signals. A faint heartbeat appeared once more. 

"Where are they?" Ally walked around and asked everyone, worried. She was in fact not busy fixing up the Ant. No one had a clue where they had gone, but that was when an emergency signal sound from the Ant's terminal. She rushed through the claustrophobic interior to answer the call.

"*OKAY, BRACE FOR IMPACT.*" A muffled voice came from the speakers, other fellows tuned in to listen.

"...Houston?!" She exclaimed, more confused than ever.

Meanwhile, Ferd and Houston have positioned themselves at the side of the collapsed Big Ant. Ferd was told to hold a defensive position, covering most of his body with his gauntlet by Houston, who was currently behind him firing as many flares as they could. The faint heartbeat grew closer and closer, until suddenly the storm stopped.

"*AND MAKE SURE NO ONE'S AT THE BELLY OF THE ANT, 'KAY?*" Everyone inside the Ant was already huddled at the cockpit, anyway.

The fog slowly cleared, and from the horizon closed in a black unstable silhouette at rapid speeds. Ferd wanted to bail out of their rancid idea so bad, but he had to stick to their secret promise. That silhouette spread out its wings, and with a booming screech similar to an eagle, it rammed head-first into Ferd and the walker. It plowed through the snow, splitting the Big Ant in half, nothing but mist coming from a never-ending crater. The shattering impact disoriented Ferd, but just after a few seconds he'd come to sense and realize the situation. Most importantly, the gauntlet protected him, but he was currently getting dragged through all the terrain by the silhouette's beak. He was nothing more than just a speck for that creature, easily the size of a building. It's constantly shifting body seemed to revolve around the form of a raven, with two heads which one of them resembled an eagle. The raven stopped with its constant plowing, letting out a numbing screech once more. Ferd seized the opportunity to climb on its head making a way to its back, grabbing onto spikes which were hopefully its feathers. The raven noticed him fairly quickly with its two heads, shaking one of its heads to rid of him, but Ferd's grip with the gauntlet was like welded steel. The raven's other head tried to bite and drag him off, but he was quick to evade, just by mere meters away from certain death. All of his devices were destroyed in the impact, he was all alone against the beast.

Ally walked out of the Ant's head with several other fellows, most injured, "What were you thinking?!" She personally yelled out at Houston.

"That was the only way to take down whatever that is quickly!" They defended themselves, "We ain't got a year, we only got a measly month!"

"Incapacitating half the crew, jeez, I can't believe you!!!" She was visibly upset, "Not even telling me or anyone else about this, you should've just stuck to your damn job Houston!!!"

Suddenly, the gravity changed again, turning harshly high. The crew were put to their knees by nature's own volition. Every single detail about this situation only made Ally more angry.

As Ferd continued to scale the raven's disturbingly long neck, the gravity change quickly forced him to plummet onto the ground. Still ahold of the beast's neck, he figured that the gravity change does not affect the creature. Using this to advantage he hugged the raven's neck to keep its whole body on the floor, crawling under the snow to slowly progress over as the raven's other head cried in pain. It extended its wings to fly, but it couldn't. It slammed its body against the ground in pure desperation, Ferd himself became a makeshift chain to contain the beast.

"Look, I know what I'm doin', promise." They looked down in guilt, "Don't judge, Ferd will come by any second now."

"HE WAS JUST TAKEN BY A- You know what, never-mind." She took a deep breath, "You're dead, so dead."

"If it makes you feel better, Ferd has been on such antics for months if not years." Vlad came around with a grouchy voice, crawling through the snow, "You two, go tend the crew, I cannot move with my prosthetic."

The gravity shift again, now much lower than it normally should be. Even a slight jump would send you flying, just like on a moon. This, of course, sent Ferd flying with the beast. The screeches could be heard from the thick fog, raising only questions from the crew.

As the raven soared through the skies, performing frantic maneuvers attempting to get rid of Ferd, he clung on its collarbone for his life. The sudden influence of gravity on the creature destabilized its flight. In a short moment of opportunity Ferd managed to take the rope he brought earlier from his bag, with a whip he got it right around its neck and tied a strong knot connected to his gauntlet amidst the trembling chaos. Finally having something reliant to hang on, he laid on the creature's back and braced for more impact. The raven turned its back onto the surface, soon diving from the skies straight into the ground. He continued to revolve from its back onto its chest around its neck to suffer the least amount of injury, a painful cycle for both of them. Ferd tried to stab it, shoot it, but all man-made weapons were utterly useless, the raven only absorbed the bullets and knives into its body. Ferd, in total struggle, tried something new and descended from its collar down onto its belly. A huge mistake, the raven seized the opportunity to claw the rope tied to his gauntlet, and with a launch paired with the lower gravity he was sent flying into the skies. 

"Houston." Ally, annoyed, decided to talk to them with a sharp stare as she tended to a fellow's leg injury, "Mind finally telling me what the whole plan was?"

"So you see, he has that gauntlet..." They scratched their head, lousily taking out the shrapnel from someone, "And only that gauntlet can damage these creatures, should be pretty easy work if he's in a panicked state, ya know?"

"How in the world would a panicked state help?!" She clearly expressed a confused face, silently judging their way of tending to injury.

A screech arose from the fog, again. Both of them looked towards the direction, leaving behind their faces for the moment.

"Y'see, maybe that's him right now creating whatever out of his mind to tear the creature down!" They raised a finger, confident in their belief.

"It hurts... It's so cold..." The patient that Houston was tending to spoke up, laying their hand on Houston's shoulder.

"Good thing it feels cold!" Houston looked to them, "Numbs the whole pain away, your body is doing it's job."

Ally opened her mouth to say something, but decided not to. Every second with them just made her more and more angry.

Ferd, soaring through the sky, took a moment to appreciate the view above the clouds and fog. There was no pretty sunset, nor a colorful dawn, the sky was space itself littered with its usual stars. The white sun radiated, casting perfect monochrome shadows. The raven flew below him, and at that second the gravity shift again to be much higher and harsher again. He was pulled, plummeting back onto the surface at lethal speeds, noticing his trajectory was perfectly aligned to collide with the raven. He smiled, and from flailing his arms he put himself on a diving position. Like a bullet he slammed onto the raven again, under the influence of gravity again both of them began their fast plummet into the ground. After the initial collision he grabbed onto its collarbone again, and with the remains of the rope still tied to his gauntlet he wrapped it around the raven, creating a much tighter knot. Right before both of them were about to slam against the cold unforgiving snow, in natural instinct Ferd pulled the rope with the gauntlet tightly against its neck, and surprisingly that forced the raven to extend its wings. Still destabilized by Ferd's gravity, the raven managed to glide beneath the clouds. Both him and the beast were surprised, the raven properly looked at him using its second head with curiosity beneath its two bleak white eyes. Staring at each other for a while, Ferd caught the potential, wherever he'd pull, the raven would go.

"yhW dluow uoy od taht? yhW dluow uoy evas em? uoY era latrommi, uoy dluow evah devil." A faint, unintelligible whisper came around him.

He didn't understand, but he spoke up in a yell in hopes of a proper response, "What are you? Why did you attack us?" It was hard to speak through the harsh wind.

"No by of duty and lands the Guardian, protecting lands, a is so just shall carved sacred to regions protect am Queen. mortal my these I our the tread birth." The whisper intensified.

"So you're saying..." Ally continued to wrap bandages around concerning injuries, "You told Ferd you'd give him the best sandwich ever if he complies to whatever nonsense you got him into?"

"Yeah, that's all it took!" They happily gestured, "A delicious, big sandwich, full of the best ingredients from each corner of the universe."

"You're making the patients hungry, stop that." She was still annoyed, "And I don't believe you, by the way."

Both of them continued to argue. The split group arrived recently, with their fully functional Big Ant that received no damage contrary to the wreck that was found here. All the fellows which were tended to were safely escorted into the walker, slowly one by one. Isaac played on a harmonica as Vlad cleaned up his weapons.

"Now what the hell happened here." Lips walked over to Houston and Ally among the patients, her bulky figure casting a menacing shadow.

"This dude decided it'd be a great idea to make Ferd bait." She pointed a finger at Houston.

"Don't say it like that! We're still waitin', no biggie." They put a box full of shrapnel aside, and started to wrap bandages around the wounds, "He's out there fighting a..."

A massive shadow obscured the sun above the temporary settlement, it was the great raven, with Ferd just sitting on its neck, somehow uninjured. It descended down, landing on the snow to lay on its belly. Ferd was immediately tackled by a tight hug from Ally.

"Dude! Don't run off like that without saying anything!" It was clear in her voice that she was worried sick.

"I told you he'd be fine." Houston looked to the side.

"Shut up!!!" She snapped at them.

Both crews surrounded the raven in awe. Some took pictures with their fellows, others tried to communicate with the beast by playing songs, it was expressionless, it just wanted to rest. It seemed like the gravity shifts have also calmed.

Vlad placed his mechanical hand on Ferd's shoulder, "You tamed this thing?" He asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Um, sort of." He was just as confused, "It's more like both of us made a deal to go on our ways, she was just doing her job of keeping the monochrome lands clean."

"Huh." Vlad crossed his arms, looking at the creature, "Impressive, nonetheless."

"This was a pretty damn boring mission." Isaac spoke up, "We did absolutely NOTHING. What the hell were you up to?!"

"I, uh." He scratched his head, "It's pretty confusing..."

In the meantime, a few crew members were confused. Lips walked up to them for a basic checkup, but stayed for something curious. They kept catching onto one signal at the terminal, this whole time assuming it's been Ferd or the beast but it was neither, it still kept going far in the distance. It wasn't the extraction they called in, either.
"Be wary." Lips spoke, "Turn off any ongoing transmissions-"

Interrupted by loud sudden bangs in the distance, tow hooks have pierced and latched on to the fragile ground of the world. Serving as ziplines seemingly from a nearby ship, figures from the fog slid down and rolled into action. Gunfire escalated, the figures dressed in an all-black tactical suit fired at any crew member, paralyzing them with a special weapon designed to stun. Houston knew what was up, they grabbed Ally's arm and ran to Ferd. 

"Ferd, where is the raven?! We need to get out of here as fast as possible!" They yelled out, terrified. Ally slid her arm from their grasp, quietly flattered.

He looked behind at all the chaos in silence, "Follow me." He gestured with his left hand to signal others behind to follow as well.

They all ran together, Vlad and Isaac joined in eventually. Vlad grabbed a large piece of scrap and used it as a shield from the incoming fire, many, if not all crew members were already paralyzed. Whoever was left came to join the pack. Lips stood her ground within the walker, protecting the two fellows around. She was hit, but she managed to proceed, fighting until she completely wasn't able to. 

"What's going on?!" Ferd yelled out at Houston, finally sighting the raven.

"That's the Babylon, dude! They caught up to us!" They yelled back, the wind still making it uneasy to speak.

One after another, all other crew members were down. Even despite firing back with actual weapons, they were outnumbered and the loss was severe. Ally was shot at the leg, the stun bullet kicking in and paralyzing her body. Houston in quick thinking grabbed both of her arms and took her to their shoulder. Isaac mercilessly fired from his personal rocket launcher as Vlad served his part as cover. The raven was fast asleep until it felt Ferd climbing on its neck again, tying a better and more comfortable rope around it's collar. He was focused, so focused, until he was tackled and punched cold into the snow by a hulky figure in the black suit. His nose bled, he looked up to whoever that was; none other than Bill himself.
