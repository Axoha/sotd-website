*Ferd...*

Masy crawls up onto the bed, within the complete darkness of the night.

*Ferd, it's me, I was so busy that-*

"...What..." Ally rose up from the bed, rubbing her eyes, just awoken.

"A-Ally?!" She backed away, "What are you doing in Ferd's new spot?"

"...Oh you must be Masy." She whispered, leaning back. "Don't be loud, he doesn't get a good night's sleep like this often."

"...What happened?" Masy slowly tilted her head, lowering her voice.

"You don't know?" She was baffled, "I thought you'd be aware."

"I'm not omniscient!" She rolled her eyes, "Please, I would deeply appreciate it if you told me. I can afford to be here the whole night."

Ally sighed, "Okay..." as she slowly got off the bed. She was careful, coming out of the bed wearing the biggest and comfiest 'bye-bye kitten' pajama pants you could ever imagine. Not wanting to turn the light on, she held Masy's hand and was led into the apartment's kitchen through the darkness. There, she told her everything that occurred, drowsily.
The following morning Ferd would wake up to a note of familiar style paired with a breakfast tray that had a neatly toasted sandwich and coffee on it. Ally was nowhere to be seen, but he didn't mind. In complete silence he grabbed the sandwich and began eating it like as if he hasn't eaten in days, and after he'd be done he would gently hold a Rubik's cube and start solving it.

"Houston." Ally crossed her arms, "What have you been up to?"

"Oh my, I was just looking for you!" They'd nervously scratch their head, "I'm so sorry, everything took a wild turn..."

"Have you even talked to Ferd?" She tilted her head.

"Matter of fact, yes." They looked down, "Y'know, I hung with him for a bit. We talked, dreamed, you didn't know?"

"Oh..." She softly placed the tip of her finger on her lip, "I didn't know." shaking her head.

"I figured you and him got a lot closer since then... I wanna say you're doing great, thanks." Their tone turned a bit somber.

"Right, I wanted to mention..." She looked to the side, "Since you know those Babylon dudes better than I do, is there any chance they would allow Ferd to go through a surgery to get rid of the gauntlet?"

Houston looked at her with surprised eyes.

"...Ferdinand will go through that, don't know when. The gauntlet *REALLY* bothers Ferd and it'd be awesome if-"

"We can't take it off him." They cut her off.

"What do you mean-"

"In Tartarus. His right arm was torn, sliced, in all those possible painful ways to detach the gauntlet, it still found its way back to his body." They sounded serious.

Ally said nothing for a short while, just squinting her eyes, "Okay, sounds about right."

"Y'know, I'm sorry, I'd love to see him free from the gauntlet." They spoke with a frown, "Back to what I was saying however, all three of us have been called to meet the boss during the noon. Please be there, thanks."

Ally only nodded in response and Houston walked away back into their room.

"Oh, Houst..." She spoke up from a distance.

Houston's ears perked up, turning around to face her.

"I'll be going out, could I get some spare change to ~~steal~~ buy something good around? Everything is mad expensive!" She gestured.

"Ally, in the most respectful way possible, you are NOT going outside like that!" They walked towards her at a fast pace shaking their head, grabbing her hand to drag her into their room. She followed with curiosity...

...And out she came, dressed fully and beautifully, coated with sweet perfume.

"Can I take off-"

"No."

"Okay... Byeeeee!" She walked out with a smile.

"Catch this!" With their debit card in-between their fingers, they throw it perfectly like a shuriken to Ally's direction. She swiftly catches it with her left hand and stores it in her pocket, turning around and winking at them before actually departing.

"Well, that settles one thing." Houston talked to themselves, "Maybe I'll check on Ferd again..."

With a calm strut, they made their way to Ally's room. Gently opening the door, Ferd was seen tearing themselves apart. Digging into the gaping wound in their chest, dozens of bleeding scratches on his right wrist. The whole room was a mess, he cried out in unintelligible pain. Houston just shrugged off the sight, tracking back into the hallway to find a janitor's room, getting all the possible cleaning equipment they'll need. With a polite knock, they got into Ally's room and pinned him on the bed.

"Ferd..." They spoke with a frown, "You don't want to do this."

He squirmed under their grip like an uncontrollable animal. Houston focused on rather getting all his guts back into his body.

"Jeez, I need a mask for this." They thought in their mind, reaching out for a pocket to put on a simple cloth mask for the nose and mouth. "Ferd, don't make me get my tranquilizers again."

With careful and precise care, Ferd's body managed to swiftly recover thanks to Houston's hand. He seemed to calm, but slowly he turned more and more upset. Houston got their hands on the various tools they brought it, spraying and wiping all the fresh blood away. They'd notice Ferd's catharsis and would sit besides him to give him a tight hug.

"All's fine now, ain't it?" They'd talk to his back, a long quiet moment came. Ferd only sniffled in response. "I got a surprise for you sometime by noon, so, just don't hurt yourself, would ya?"

They couldn't see, but they felt Ferd nod on their shoulder. After the moment was over, Houston stood up and took a look at Ferd before leaving, thinking of something to say.

"Sorry for giving you such a scare. Y'know, I just want it over with as fast as possible. Don't be afraid to come by if you need help." And the door closed.

The clock ticked, noon came by. Ally spent most of her time roaming the city of Saint Kalina, one of the seven core capitals of the New Babylon, where they were currently living at, where Houston and Ferd stole the gauntlet, and where... Ally showed off some cool gadgets she found in her shopping journey to Ferd, hoping to amuse him somewhat.

"Thank god you're here, this bunch seems so much nicer than those damn Disobedients!" Rose complained to Bill behind a desk, "Where are they? They're already a minute late!"

"Sir, we're right here." Houston was politely sat in between Ferd and Ally on three separate chairs.

"Oh, perfect! Where the hell did you come from?!" He snapped at them.

"Don't be loud!" She snapped back at Rose, "Keep it down?! Christ."

"Okay, my sincerest apologies." He coughed into a fist without a mouth, "You three are important for something spectacular, and I promise, this will be the second to last spectacular thing that'll happen to you."

Ferd nervously fidgeted with his hands.

"So to begin here, we're following a prophecy..."

"...Months ago we started researching the underworld and the Inkas, familiar with that term, hm? We struck their core, and there was a prophecy written clearly in a language that could be understood by anyone with special black-tinted glasses made out of the black reflective spirals. At first, such an odd occurrence, but the whole oddity only worsened once it was found that if it were not to be followed, the end of the world will come - an apocalypse labeled as the 'Reconstruction'..."

*My little red rascal, I cannot offer more help. I am sorry, my knowledge has its limits. 小さな赤い天使さん、これ以上のお手伝いはできません。申し訳ありませんが、私の知識には限界があります. help. has limits. I little I am knowledge red My my offer its cannot rascal, more 小さな赤い天使さん、これ以上のお手伝いはできません。申し訳ありませんが、私の知識には限界があります. sorry,*

"...The recent re-entry of the 'Angel of War', known to be Ferdinand Ray, has raised immense question. Nothing of that was written in the prophecy, so now we demand more answers. Tomorrow, you three will be sent into the heart of the underworld to check the prophecy once again."

*"You don't want to do this alone, do you?"*

*"It's all been leading up to this, hasn't it?"*

*The heart continues to walk, together with the two closest friends.*

*"Is it not crazy that it ends right here?"*

*"After all the adventures we've been through..."*

"Ferd?" Ally nudged at him, speaking softly, "Are you okay?"

He stared blankly, a tear expelled from his right eye.

"Um, Houst." Ally stood up, "Could you please finish this whole meeting thing for us and then tell everything later? We need to go." She awkwardly chuckled, getting Ferd out of his seat.

"Sure, that works." Understanding, they got back to listening to Rose's mission briefing.

Half an hour later. Ferd and Ally were both in her room again, listening to some music, until a gentle knock was heard on the door. Ally stood up, opened the door, and Houston came by holding a tray of something obscured by silver food dome - holding the whole thing with two mittens of course.

"Okay, okay, I don't have time, but I have something crazy for y'all..." They placed the new tray on the bed, taking out the breakfast tray out.

"You're bringing in surprises?" She asked with curiosity.

"I stepped up my sandwich game, watch this..." With striking enthusiasm they slowly raised the food dome.

Two burgers, steaming hot, paired with golden Belgian fries and sauces of all kind. The burger had it all, everything to make it taste as great as possible. Both Ally and Ferd stared at it, drooling.

"All yours, this is what I'm truly capable of!" They smiled, "As long as you stay I can keep making burgers. *Now don't mind me I'll kindly take this ol' tray out...*" And the door closed again.

"Well, that settles another thing." Houston talked to themselves, "What's this note?"

*Dear Ferd,*
*If Ally did not tell you, we will meet in the underworld again.*
*And that moment will be the only time we will have a shot at changing the soon ending prophecy.*
*I am wishing you the best, I truly do.*
*I am sending lots of love, from my sisters and brothers.*
