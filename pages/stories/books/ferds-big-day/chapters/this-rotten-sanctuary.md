*Oh, the Disobedient,*
*What a glorious force!*

*United under our Red - Stark - Flag,*
*praising our golden bird all the way!*

*Oh, the Disobedient,*
*Always a joy to meet!*

*Fierce mighty hammers swing Up - And - Down,*
*every one needs to play their part!*

On a distant planet, in a designated sector forgotten many, lays a planet named "Onder-5", known as well as "home" by the squad and many other Disobedient allies. It is considered a Disobedient scrap planet, serving only to hold a defensive border against any threat that may appear. Scrap planets are poor, much of the tech that is sent here for missions by the higher rank are made of weak material. Whoever is unfortunate enough to be assigned to such planet has to improvise with various thrown away metal and recycled machinery.
The extraction ship has finally entered the atmosphere, a clear blue sky paired with abnormally average clouds and a beautiful green landscape mostly composed of giant pine trees. The ship descended further into the thick valleys, in a plain cleared out area a huge retreat stood out. There were containers, redesigned into homes, lots of red cloth, wooden stalls, a surprisingly cozy place for such an idea. There were hints of futuristic tech lying around, usually just thrown somewhere to be repurposed or adapted into human needs such as heaters and furniture. The ship landed, and the trio walked out unamused, their monthly mission was over. Vlad walked right through his greenhouse into his home, dropping Isaac's limb into his empty emergency aquarium. That limb awkwardly floated there for a moment before sinking onto the glass floor and slowly morphing into what seemed to be a normal axolotl. Vlad closely watched, and tapped the glass when the morphing completed and the axolotl turned responsive. Ena and Ferd strut back to their home like as if they were on a honeymoon, the multiple allies they brushed over questioned when they would finally get married. Some allies played harmonicas, some cheered for whenever someone came back alive, it was a lovely community where everyone respected each other no matter what.

In the afternoons, a band would often form around a single small television screen that broadcasted whatever news the higher rank had. Ena and Ferd lately decided to tune in for the news, listening to whatever they had to say.

"...contributing to the war effort, many troops have chosen to be deployed at the planet of Mog..."

"...successfully clearing out any 'Citadelarian' threat, the scrap planet border reaches newer bounds..."

"...this month at our time the 'Citadelarian' threat has been slowly regressing altogether..."

"...there is no development on the 'New Babylon' supporting the cause, claiming they need to 'stay as neutral as possible', as stated by the minister of defense for unknown reasons..."

"...production expenses from the 'Dawn of the Green Light' keep rising, technology cuts may need to be made to sustain a healthy relationship as stated by a Disobedient war commander..."

"...tensions rise between the Disobedients and the 'Resistance' as newly hired mercenaries find rancid ways of completing missions, costing 'too much'..."

"...remember to stay vigilant..."

"I cannot believe you all really watch that junk." Vlad's coarse voice sound from the outside. He was leaning onto a wall, lighting and smoking a cigar.

Everyone looked towards him, "But what if we want to hear news?" Ena asked, "Like, how space is developing and stuff."

"It's all just the same dance, every week." He got ahold of his cigar and blew smoke, "There is no real development, they just say whatever to satisfy the poor."

"Wow, what a way to ruin the vibe chief." Someone in the group spoke up, seemingly with lots of pent up feeling. "Ever since your newbie ass got here everything has gone gloomier, thanks a lot." They scoffed.

Vlad turned his head to the inside of the room, and slowly walked in, having to bend a little to fit through the entrance. He grabbed their shoulder, looking down on them, "Kind words, if you are not happy then you can leave." His look was off-putting.

"Who are you to speak like a leader?" They were confused.

"Thirty. Years. Serving my Resistance." He gripped their shoulders, his face close to theirs, "I travelled through the stars, I saw it all. I accomplished all my missions, all my tasks. I lost my skin, I lost my arm, I lost my humanity, a perfectly fine human being should hold some respect for such a veteran, no?"

They looked like they had something to say, but closed their mouth, "I suppose so, sir."

"Thank you, little one." He pat their back, and walked away back to his spot.

"Such an odd-ball." They murmured silently, "How do you two even put up with this guy?" They directly asked Ferd and Ena.

"Um..." Ferd scratched his head, "He's sometimes *grunchy*, just respect him as an ally and he won't be like that." Ena wanted to say something as well, but ended up nodding as he finished his sentence.

As the sun set and the night came, mostly everyone went back to their homes close by after hanging out around a campfire. Playing songs, telling stories, building relations, just general things that kept their spirits alive. Vlad would spend most of his time tending to his personal garden, growing and journaling all sorts of exotic plants he had picked up on his way from missions. He'd take care of his personal massive aquarium, too, dazed in the sight of fish swimming around the rocks and the wooden barks.
Ena and Ferd, those two, wild shots. Ignoring their curfew all the time, running into the forests to experience something thrilling. They never got bored of each other, ever, even if Ena sometimes acted like a jerk. She was sassy and smug, initiating competitive scenes out of the blue against Ferd. Often times he'd let her win and she'd laugh, feeding into her ego just for joy. They were free and wild, and often times they'd sit closely together on a cliffside where the sun always rises. The cliff was high above the ocean, the waves crashed towards the spires making soothing noises paired with the salty cold breeze. During the nights they'd always converse about personal things, never anywhere else.

Ena was sweating bullets, her chest heaving as she took deep breaths, "Sheesh, that was fun." She sat down on at their favorite cliffside.

Ferd was just a little dazed at the sight of her, but he'd quickly come to sense, "Um, yeah!" Unlike her he wasn't sweating at all, yet he won the race she established minutes ago.

"Seven years huh..." She'd spark another conversation, "It's hard to believe it was so long, felt like a whole thrilling rush that I was missing in my life."

"I hardly even remember what life used to be like before." He'd gladly sigh, "But I know for certain that this is much more fun than whatever was going on before."

"How many years left do we have for retirement? How close is that blissful life we keep dreaming about?" She'd tilt her head, facing Ferd.

"Um, let me see..." He'd take out his personal phone from the pocket, tapping on the screen looking for notes. Ena would grab onto him, looking very woozy.

"Oh, oh, sorry, I'm just really tired." She'd yawn and put herself back in place, before coming back to rest her head on his shoulder, "Jeez man you have a lot of notes."

"Yeah, yeah..." He'd blindly respond.

She chuckled after seeing a certain note, but looked away and whistled once Ferd turned to her head. "There it is." He said, "Fifteen years of service is required at minimum for retirement, that leaves us at eight more years."

"...sounds perfectly enough until we start getting tired of this." She'd reply, with a hint of sarcasm.

"Sweetie, you okay? You don't look just tired." Ferd asked with concern.

"Well, I wanted to talk about something huge today." She'd giggle, "I looked further into this whole retirement nonsense..."

"Yeah..?" Ferd would lean closer to her as she spoke.

"Well..." She was gathering thought, kind of busy chuckling.

"...Yeah???" Ferd was joyfully confused.

"Honey, I'm pregnant." She smiled.
