*Seven centuries ago,* in the deep voids of space, a nation was formed of machines, known to be as the *"Citadel"*.

*Seven decades ago,* one of the first major extraterrestrial wars broke out in an alternate timeline between the Citadel and a united humanity later labeled as the *"Disobedient"*.

*Seven years ago,* the figures *Ferd Ray* and *Ena Lone* unknowingly enlisted for military service in a Disobedient-seized earth. Somehow, surprisingly, they found to be enjoying their newfound life.

*Seven months ago,* the two were bundled together with two other several figures, soon to be sent onto a Disobedient-seized planet right on the frontlines of war.

*Seven days ago,* the squad is informed of another mission, preparations begin for a potential advancement.

*Seven hours ago,* the squad is deployed on an unknown volcanic and ashy planet, tasked to destroy a *Citadelarian tower*.

*Seven minutes ago,* the squad slowly drive away in their damaged all-terrain vehicle after failing their mission, terribly.

"This rots." Someone spoke up amidst the silence in a somewhat squeaky voice, belonging to a small brown axolotl.

Vladimir Koshinov, the undead mercenary and leader of the squad, squeezed in front of the steering wheel growled in immense pent-up frustration. Twice the size of an average human being, no one wanted to say a single word. Ferd looked back and forth at Ena and the rest of the squad, he raised a finger and slightly opened his mouth, ready to speak. Ena silently gestured frantically telling him its not a good idea.

"Do not." Vlad's grouchy deep voice sounded from the steering wheel, Ferd bulged his eyes and took a deep breath.

"JusthearmewhatifwetryagainbutthistimewefocusonDISABLINGtheshieldgeneratorsratherthantryingtodestroythewholetoweraltogethersoreinforcmentscouldpossiblymaybehitthetowerwithdevastatingstrikes?"

Everyone looked towards Ferd, even Vlad, who was driving. In that silent moment the vehicle steered away from the path and hit a spike trip, completely crippling the already damage vehicle more. Their location device suddenly sounded.

"Approximately five-thousand two-hundred meters away from the designated extraction point, are you stopping for a small break? Chirp chirp~"

Vlad covered his face with both of his hands, rubbing his eyes from sheer tiredness and exhaustion. "Come up with a plan, boy. Don't waste no more of my time."

The wind howled, with a distant sound of tumbleweeds rolling over and past by. Ferd looked back at the looming Citadelarian tower behind them, it's silhouette was black in the green horizon of this world. "Sweetie, what equipment do we have?"

"We're really doing this huh." Ena smirked, opening a heavy bag under her legs, "We got small flares, really strong flares, expendable cannons, shells, remote controlled explosives, a red bird plushie, average small guns for the each of us, all the good stuff we were packed with."

"Don't we also have some sort of emergency device that let's us call in extraction anywhere sooner?" Ferd questioned, "Those ships are always heavily armed for some reason, since we have no reinforcement maybe we could *trick* the extraction team into helping us take down this tower?"

The small brown axolotl, who's names was Isaac, simply just tilt his head down and shook his head, "Oh, they're gonna have us working so much overtime for that."

"Can't imagine coming back empty handed." Ferd replied with a slight hint of arrogance.

"Besides, how do we even want to get past their defense? We were swarmed, the operation did not state there to be so many. Now we don't even have our little doohickey to go there with." Ena looked down, examining the various equipment they brought over.

"We surrender, but not actually." Ferd plotted, "Their shield generators are always built on the outside, we just need an opportunity to blow it up."

Isaac shook his head again, "Oh, we're gonna be slaving away for the whole month."

"...And what about the extraction ship? That's never allowed to be called in at enemy airspace, it's gonna get blown in seconds!" Ena argued.

"Well." Ferd looked away for a bit, trying to come up with an idea, "We blow up their anti-air too!"

Vlad placed his cold left mechanical arm on Ferd's shoulder, "Reckless, sure, let us do that."

*A moment of walking and sharing ideas later.*

"Greetings! We come in peace, our hands are up, our weapons disabled, come take us." Ferd spoke up in front of the massive defensive walls of the tower.

"Chou rweally houldm't make t-hat lessh shushp-" Ena spoke with a full mouth, but was swiftly cut of by the loud mechanical whirrs and steam hisses from the insides of the walls. The bricks of the wall shifted exposing holes from where heavy rifles swiftly came up. Lasers were turned on and each member of the squad had at least three dozens of them aimed at their body, a single suspicious move would end their lives in an instant.

"██████ ███████████ ████ ████ ████████ ███ ██████████ ██ █████ ██ ███ ████ ██ ███ ████████" A loud gnarly voice came sounding from what seemed to be a megaphone, unintelligible in their language. The squad only stood still, without doing anything, not moving a single inch. After some time of holding their breath and hearing the wind howl, a groan was heard and a megaphone was thrown across the wall. Bricks have continued shifting to form an open entrance, from where multiple Citadelarians came from to observe the squad in a tight form, one weaselly Citadelarian was sent to retrieve the megaphones. These Citadelarians were the average alien to encounter, limbless, their feet and hands connected to their bodies using advanced magnetic force. They were known for their brutalist architecture, their green colors, and their freakish nature for total control. One stood out from the rest in the formation, that was to be considered an "elite", they were purely white with crimson red marks instead of the usual green.

"█████ █████ ███████████ ██ ███ █████ █ ██████ ███████" The elite spoke, supposedly informing its formation on what to do.

"Speak up?" Ferd raised an eyebrow and asked, the elite stared back with its only eye, unamused.

"We will show some kindness for your action, you will not be executed, you will be imprisoned." The elite came up close to Ferd. Some Citadelarians in the background worked together to disconnect Vlad's huge mechanical left arm made of strong steel.

As they were all slowly searched and restrained, Ena looked back to Isaac and Vlad, who silently gestured back that they were ready for what's to come. The squad was slowly escorted into the tower, not so heavily guarded anymore. Isaac was missing a limb, all a part of their plan, it was safely tucked within Vlad's coat. Once they reached the shield generators Isaac quietly slid his way to be in front of Vlad, and in a sudden move, he kicked the small axolotl with an enormous force. Isaac went flying straight into the generators, he ignited himself and exploded causing a massive blast. Every Citadelarian was distraught, and in that moment of advantage the trio took an opportunity to disarm and knock out the few security guards that were escorting them. Ferd laid down and stretched his handcuffed arms to the direction of Vlad, who'd swiftly stomp on them to break the chain. Ferd would then run over to Ena, but before releasing the cuffs he'd take their small extraction doohickey from her mouth, immediately initiating the countdown sequence. They were now all free, dual-wielding the Citadelarian standard issue rifles, which were incredibly lightweight. The Citadelarians opened fire without any mercy, but the trio was quick to act, taking cover getting just grazed by the lasers. Tactically moving throughout the outskirts of the tower they finally reached the belongings that were taken from them, but most importantly they retrieved the communication device.

"Hello hello? Red Valiant oh-one here, copy?" A voice came from the phone-like device.

"Copy, expect us at the top of the tower." Vlad grabbed the device and responded.

Ferd and Ena retrieved Isaac's rocket launcher, together using lots of their strength to aim it at even more defensive systems of the tower. One by one, Ena fired the rockets as Ferd scoured the place around for more shells. Sentries, cannons, all vital equipment exploded one by one. In a short intermission, Ferd dug through the taken equipment and retrieved Vlad's left arm, and the round pair of glasses that mean a lot to him. Ena walked by, gave him a smug look, and just picked up the whole bag and carried it on her back.

"Estimated time of arrival, twenty seconds, copy? Alive?" The pilot announced themselves once more.

"YUP, WE'RE HOLDING OUT HERE!" Ferd urgently responded, the gunfire was relentless.

"I don't see anything on the rooftop, where are you?" Concerned, confused, he spoke.

"I'm afraid we're not making it!" Ena took ahold of the device, "If you still don't see us, just destroy the tower!"

"Copy." The pilot continued to speak, "It's been an honor serving you, never got boring ever."

The extraction ship descended from the night sky, its wings spread out extruding various rockets and weaponry. In an instant, the ship opened fire at the lower levels of the tower, its machine guns tearing through the foundations and walls, coupled with the endless blasts from the missiles. Not even a dozen of seconds later, the tower was already collapsing on its own.

"Mission acc-"

"We're down here!" Ferd spoke through the device.

"Excuse me?!" The pilot was flabbergasted, "What do you mean?!"

"Yeah we felt a bit silly here just come pick us up, thanks brodie." Ena spoke up.

"You know that- Never mind, I'll let this slide..." The pilot scoffed.

Once the ship landed, the trio walked inside and sat themselves. The pilot pulled out a log book and clicked with a pen, "So, how do you dare excuse the missing emergency weaponry?"

"Um..." Ferd gripped his knees, "I..."

"There was simply no choice, we needed reinforcements." Vlad spoke up as he was mounting his left arm back, "I believe that qualifies as a proper response, write something good and convincing."

"Got that." The pilot murmured as they started writing, "Be glad each one of you belongs to the lesser known branch of the Disobedient, partially collaborative with the resistance, I bet those guys will never get enough of this story."

A boring conversation sparked between Vlad and the pilot, Ferd looked at the lights of the ship as the background noise went on. Ena bumped into him, telling him to turn to her. She was holding two collars, both with a special medal that symbolized their relationship. She slowly wrapped it around his neck, and later to hers.

"You almost forgot." She grinned, "Those aliens took that from us as well!"
